# Governance
Governance is about defining, establishing and enforcing the processes of developing APIs, testing APIs, and getting them into production in a consistent and secure way. It entails knowing your APIs, your data and your risks
## Benefits
- Consistency 
- Setting expectations
- Establishing standard processes
- Enforcing security
## Know your APIs
- Get full inventory of APIs
	- purpose, owner, documentation
- Standardise and enforce API deployment process
	- deployed with proper validation and enforce governance at Gateway/Marketplace
- Mandate API documentation 
	- Make sure APIs are consistent and reusable
	- Define documentation requirements
- Create API development standards
	- Style guides, authentication requirement, versioning, PII tracking
## Know Your Risks - Threat Modelling
- Identify: APIs, business flows, data, access path
- Assess: vulnerabilities, logic flaws, access controls, 3rd party risk
- Probability: examine the likelihood of an attack
- Impact: understand the damage , loss, consequences of an attack
- Mitigation: develop a plan to address the risk
## Documentation: OPENAPI Specification(Swagger)
It defines the API capability
- Title,description, version
- Base-URL
- Endpoints, paths
- Requests, response payloads
- Authentication requirements
- Parameters, data types
- Methods
It is not optional; Industry standards for REST APIs; Usually machine-readable(JSON, YAML); aids development and 3rd party integration; also aids security testing; can be manually or auto-generated; controls what's public or private.
Always retire old documentation- huge threat vector.
## Design Guides
- Authentication - type(basic, token, certificate), how to implement
- Authorisation - who has access to what, where enforced
- Naming convention - URIs as nouns, Methods as verbs, pluralisation, hierarchy, case, language, no jargon/abbreviations
- Error codes - status codes, reference ID, human readable messages
- Versioning - when to increment, when not, types of versions
- Units, formats, standards - date/time formats, time-zones

# Testing
Testing is about ensuring that your APIs perform as expected and are free of vulnerabilities or other flaws that can be exploited.
- Where do you want to find API vulnerabilities?
	- Pre-production
	- Production
- Standard playbook test categories offer limited value
	- They cover XSS, injection, buffer overflow
	- It is important to run these tests to avoid bot-based attacks
	- Most API breaches aren't caused by these but rather by business logic flaws

> [!NOTE]
> There is a need for API-first testing.

## Testing Categories
### API Security
- Unsecured endpoints
- Authentication exploits
- Enumeration
- App DOS, rate limiting
- Missing TLS, SSL issues
- Injection, fuzzing
-  Input validation
- Server-side resource fogery
- Server properties leaks
### Data Security
- Access control
- Excessive data exposure
- Sensitive data exposure
- Personal, health, bank data
- File, directory exposure
- Encryption at rest, transit
- Data exfiltration
### Business Logic
- Cross-account access
-  API function abuse
- Role-based access control
- Pentesting
# Monitoring
Monitoring is about runtime monitoring of those APIs to make sure they're behaving as expected, there arenâ€™t attacks in process that are succeeding or other anomalous behaviour on your APIs.
## Runtime Protection
- Policy enforcement
- Authentication
- Traffic filtering
## Threat Detection
- Fraudulent traffic
- Distributed attacks
- Incident response
## Control Validation
- Verify API controls
- Uncover anomalies
## Monitoring Approaches
### Proactive: Blocking
Policy enforcement, IP whitelisting, rate limiting
- API Gateway
- Web App Firewall
### Reactive: Alerting
Used when there isn't enough context
- Logging, SIEM
- Runtime API Threat Management
## API Discovery
- Monitoring can aid API inventory afforts
	- Identify API endpoints in use
	- Discover undocumented/unknown APIs
- Comprehensive discovery requires more sources:
	- API Gateways, Web Application Firewall
	- Code repo
	- Application testing, crawling
- Reliance on traffic based-discovery misses:
	- Internal API traffic not seen traffic analysis tool
	- Pre-production APIs
	- Unexercised endpoints
## Limitations of Monitoring
- Difficult to get full visibility
	- Requires sensors on every network segment
- High false positives on threat detection
	- Live traffic contains limited context
	- Difficult to identify data access violations in real-time
	- API monitoring tools typically used in alert only
- SaaS-based monitoring requires sharing traffic with 3rd parties
	- Privacy concerns
	- Bandwidth requirements
- Traffic blocking solutions can add latency

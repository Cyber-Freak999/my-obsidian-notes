# TL;DR

- **Groups** in OCI IAM are collections of users with common roles and permissions.    
- They simplify access management by allowing permissions to be applied to groups rather than individual users.
- Groups help with security and compliance by making access easier to audit.
- **Two default groups** exist in every identity domain:
    1. **Domain Administrators** – full control over domain; cannot be deleted.
    2. **All Domain Users** – includes all users by default; cannot be seen in Groups tab or deleted.
- Additional groups can be created based on organization structure (e.g., Engineering, Marketing).
- Only **Domain Admins** can create/manage groups in their identity domain.

# **What is a Group in OCI IAM?**

A **group** is an IAM construct used to manage **permissions and policies** for a set of users collectively rather than individually.

Think of a group as a team:

- Instead of assigning policies one user at a time, you assign them to the group.
    
- All users in that group inherit the group's permissions.
    
# **Why Use Groups?**

- Simplified Access Management: Managing hundreds of users is complex. Groups let you manage access more efficiently.
- Consistency: Ensures users with similar job roles have the same permissions.
- Better Security & Compliance: 
	- Easy to audit group access.
	- Quickly identify which group has access to sensitive resources.
- Easier Administration: Domain Admins can structure groups to match organizational units (Finance, Engineering, etc.).
# **Default Groups in Each Identity Domain**

When a new identity domain is created, two groups are created by default:
## 1. **Domain Administrators**

- **Purpose:** Administer the identity domain.
    
- **Characteristics:**
    
    - Created automatically when the domain is created.
        
    - **Includes the initial domain admin user**.
        
    - **Cannot be deleted.**
        
    - **Must always have at least one user**.
        
    - Any user added here gets **full domain control** — be cautious.
## 2. **All Domain Users**

- **Purpose:** Group that includes **all users** in the domain.
    
- **Characteristics:**
    
    - Users are automatically added to this group when created.
        
    - Cannot be seen in the **Groups tab**.
        
    - Cannot be deleted or managed by the admin.
        
    - If you assign permissions to this group, **every user in the domain** will get access to those resources.
        
    - Useful, but must be used carefully to avoid over-permissioning.
# **Custom Groups**
You can create as many **custom groups** as needed, such as:
- `NetworkAdmins`
- `AppDevelopers`
- `HR_Team`
Once created:
1. Add users to the group.
2. Attach IAM **policies** to define what members can do.

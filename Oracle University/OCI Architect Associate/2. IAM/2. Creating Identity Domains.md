# TL;DR

This lesson explains why it's important to create multiple identity domains in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), even though a default domain exists. Key reasons include:

- **Administrative isolation:** Each domain acts as a separate container, allowing teams or departments to manage their own identities, applications, and security policies independently.
- **Access control and compliance:** Different domains allow different security settings and policies (e.g., production vs. development) for better data protection and regulatory compliance.
- **Simplified identity management:** Helps in organizing and managing users and resources across large organizations.
- **Granular administrative roles:** Each domain can have its own admins, like security or application admins, for precise control.
- **Automatic creation of admin user and group:** When a domain is created, an admin group and user are also created by default.
- **Regional considerations:** The region selected during domain creation becomes its home region. Unlike the default domain, additional domains are **not automatically replicated** to other regionsâ€”you must enable replication if cross-region access is needed.

# Why Create Multiple Identity Domains?

1. **Isolation of Administrative Control:**
    
    - Different domains help separate identity management across departments or environments (e.g., production vs. development).
        
    - This prevents unauthorised access or accidental interference.
        
2. **Security and Compliance:**
    
    - Domains allow for **custom security policies** and compliance settings.
        
    - For example, production users may have stricter policies compared to development users.
        
3. **Organisational Structure:**
    
    - Just like organising files in folders, identity domains help organise users and apps logically.
        
    - This is especially useful for **large organisations** with many users and departments.
        
4. **Granular Admin Control:**
    
    - You can assign specific admin roles within each domain (e.g., security admin, app admin).
        
    - This delegation improves flexibility and operational efficiency.
        
5. **Admin User and Group on Creation:**
    
    - When a domain is created:
        
        - A default **admin user** and **admin group** are created.
            
        - The admin can manage users, groups, apps, MFA, password policies, and even enable self-registration.
6. **Home Region Consideration:**
    
    - The region selected during domain creation becomes the **domain's home region**.
        
    - Unlike the default domain, additional identity domains are **not automatically replicated** to other subscribed regions.
        
    - If required, **you must manually enable replication** for cross-region functionality.

# ⚙️ **Background Concepts**

## 🔐 **Introspection**

Defined in [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662), introspection allows a **trusted client (like a gateway)** to ask the Authorization Server (AS) about the status and contents of a token.

**Request:**

```http
POST /introspect
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic base64(client_id:secret)

token=abc123
```

**Response (if token is active):**

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "sub": "user123",
  "scope": "invoice_read",
  "client_id": "my-client",
  "iat": 1718650000,
  "exp": 1718653600,
  "aud": "api.invoice"
}
```

But this **raw JSON** response is problematic to forward directly to APIs due to:

- **Audit integrity** (anyone can fabricate JSON)
- **Loss of cryptographic signature**
- **No standard way to verify origin**

---

# 🧙 **The Problem**

Gateways often receive **reference (opaque)** tokens from external clients.  
They **must validate them** before forwarding to internal APIs.

> But APIs typically want **signed JWTs**, not JSON blobs.

---

# 🔁 **Solution: Combine Introspection with Token Exchange**

## 🎭 Enter the **Phantom Token Flow**:

- **External clients** → use opaque tokens (no PII exposure)
- **Gateways** → introspect and **exchange** them for JWTs    
- **Internal APIs** → receive **signed JWTs** with claims/scopes    

---

# 🔄 **Token Exchange in Detail (RFC 8693)**

Token Exchange allows the gateway to ask:

> _"Here’s a valid opaque token. Give me a new JWT version of it."_

**Request:**

```http
POST /token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic base64(gateway-client:secret)

grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
subject_token=abc123
subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt
scope=invoice_read
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "access_token": "<JWT_here>",
  "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 300,
  "scope": "invoice_read"
}
```

> ✅ The AS issues a **signed JWT** containing claims, scopes, audience, and expiry.

# 🔌 **Gateway Behavior**

1. **Receives opaque token** from external client.    
2. **Performs introspection** or **token exchange**:    
    - If introspection only → gets raw claims (bad to forward).        
    - If token exchange → gets signed JWT (preferred).        
3. **Validates JWT** (optional if directly from AS).    
4. **Forwards JWT** to the internal API via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.    

---

# 🧠 **Why Exchange Instead of Raw JSON?**

|Concern|Introspection (JSON)|Token Exchange (JWT)|
|---|---|---|
|Secure forwarding|❌ Fabricatable JSON|✅ Signed JWT|
|Audit trail|❌ Fragile|✅ Strong (proof of issuance)|
|Compatibility with downstream APIs|❌ Custom parsing|✅ Standard JWT parsing|
|Zero trust support|❌ Weak|✅ Strong (verifiable identity)|

---

# 🔐 **Security Benefits**

- Keeps **PII and user data inside the perimeter** (opaque externally).    
- Allows **JWT validation at the API**, even in **polyglot environments**.    
- Enforces **consistent authorization logic** across all APIs.    
- Prevents **internal token forgery** (JSON ≠ JWT).    

---

## 📡 **Optimizing Exchange Flow**

1. **Always issue opaque tokens** to public clients.    
2. **Configure gateway** as a trusted client for introspection/exchange.    
3. **Use scopes to determine audience claims** per target API.    
4. **Cache exchanged JWTs** internally (respecting TTL) to reduce latency.    

---

## 🧰 Optional Enhancements

- **DPoP or Mutual TLS**: For stronger sender-constrained tokens.    
- **Audience Restrictions**: Limit exchanged JWTs to target API.    
- **Token Chaining**: Use exchange to generate a new token when API1 calls API2.

### 📌 Flow Recap

```text
[Client] -- opaque token --> [Gateway]
       -- token exchange --> [Auth Server]
                          <-- signed JWT ---
       -- JWT --> [API]
```

**Q1:** How can token exchange be used to minimize privilege scope during API chaining?

**Q2:** What are the performance trade-offs of using introspection vs. token exchange at scale?

**Q3:** How would you design fallback mechanisms in case token exchange fails in a multi-tenant gateway setup?

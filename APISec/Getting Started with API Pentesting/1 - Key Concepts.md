# üîê **Top 4 API Security Attack Vectors:**

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
    - Pen testers look for ways to bypass or break authentication.
    - Common flaws: weak tokens, poor session management, missing role checks.
    - Goal: Gain unauthorized access or perform privileged actions.
2. **Excessive Data Exposure**
    - APIs sometimes return too much internal data, relying on the client to filter it.
    - Testers examine responses for unintended details like user PII, debug info, or DB schema.
3. **Mass Assignment**
    - APIs that automatically bind input data to internal objects can be abused.
    - Attackers exploit this to modify protected fields (e.g., `isAdmin`, `userRole`) by injecting extra parameters.
4. **Lack of Rate Limiting**
    - Without request throttling, APIs are vulnerable to brute force, scraping, or DoS attacks.
    - Testers simulate high-volume traffic to test for resilience.
# üß™ **API Penetration Testing Methods:**

1. **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**
    - **What it is**: Analyzing API source code, configs, or definitions before runtime.
    - **Purpose**: Catch bugs early (e.g., insecure input handling).
    - **Tools**: _SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify_.
2. **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**
    - **What it is**: Simulates external attacks on a running API.
    - **Purpose**: Test how the API behaves in real-world conditions.
    - **Tools**: _OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, API-specific scanners_.
3. **HAST (Human Application Security Testing)**
    - **What it is**: Manual or semi-automated testing by humans, often with context-aware scripts.
    - **Purpose**: Validate business logic and nuanced security issues.
    - **Tools**: _Postman collection runner_.
# üîÑ **Security Throughout the SDLC: Shift Left & Shift Right**

- **Shift Left Security**
    - Integrate security early in development (e.g., code reviews, early SAST).
    - Benefits: early detection, lower fix cost, better team collaboration.
- **Shift Right Security**
    - Focus on post-deployment security (e.g., monitoring, threat detection, incident response).
    - Benefits: real-time protection, faster response to live threats.
- **Best Practice:** Combine both approaches for **end-to-end security** across the software lifecycle.

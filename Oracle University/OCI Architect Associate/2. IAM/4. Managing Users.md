# User Lifecycle in OCI IAM

|**Stage**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Non-existent**|User profile doesn‚Äôt exist.|
|**Deactivated**|User is created but temporarily inactive (e.g., before joining). No login or access allowed.|
|**Activated**|User can log in and access resources as per their group permissions.|
|**Deactivated (again)**|Temporarily block access (e.g., sabbatical, suspension). Can be reactivated.|
|**Deleted**|User account permanently removed. Access, group memberships, and admin roles are revoked.|

# Who Can Manage Users?

|**Role**|**Scope**|
|---|---|
|**Tenancy Admin**|Full control across all identity domains in the tenancy.|
|**Domain Admin**|Full control within their assigned identity domain.|
|**User with Assigned Role (e.g., User Manager)**|Can manage users if granted permissions through IAM policies.|

üìù **Policy Example**:

```plaintext
Allow group UserManagers to manage users in tenancy
```

This allows any user in the `UserManagers` group to create, modify, or delete users.
# User Onboarding Methods

|**Method**|**Use Case**|
|---|---|
|**OCI Console / API**|Best for quick, manual creation of a few users.|
|**CSV Import**|Used for bulk onboarding (e.g., hiring new department staff).|
|**Self-Registration**|Enables consumer users to register themselves (controlled via profiles).|
|**External Directory Integration**|For enterprise environments needing sync with external sources like AD, Oracle HCM, or LDAP.|

# **External User Sync Methods:**

- **App Catalog:** Prebuilt integrations for Oracle HCM, Oracle Unified Directory, etc.
    
- **SCIM APIs:** Standards-based APIs for user lifecycle automation from external apps.
    
- **Provisioning Bridge / AD Bridge:** Software components for syncing users from on-prem AD or directories.
    
- **Just-In-Time Provisioning:** Auto-creates users during first login via federation (e.g., SAML or OAuth2).
# **Key Benefits of Lifecycle Management in OCI IAM**

- Supports **automation**, **compliance**, and **security policies**.
    
- Enables **fine-grained control** over user access at different stages of employment.
    
- Integrates with **enterprise tools** for centralized identity management.

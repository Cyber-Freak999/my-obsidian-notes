- Learning involves forming connections between neurons in the brain.
- The "learn it" stage involves the introduction of new information or skills, where connections begin forming under guidance.
- The "link it" stage strengthens these neural connections as students retrieve and practice learned material independently.
- Long-term memories are stored in the neocortex, a thin layer on the surface of the brain.
- Although the brain has a vast storage capacity, the challenge lies in effectively storing and retrieving information.
- Techniques such as rereading, highlighting, retrieval practice, and creating concept maps are explored for efficiency in memory retention.
- Retrieval practice, or active recall, is highlighted as a powerful learning technique.

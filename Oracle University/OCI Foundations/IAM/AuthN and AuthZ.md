**Principal**: Any IAM entity (user or resource) allowed to intereact with OCI Resources.
- **Users**: Real people using console, CLI, SDKs.
- **Resource Principals**: OCI resources like compute instances making API calls. 
**Groups**: Collections of users with similar access needs.

# âœ… **Authentication (AuthN)** â€“ _"Are you who you say you are?"_

Used to verify identity. OCI supports three main types:

1. **Username/Password**    
    - Standard login to OCI console.
2. **API Signing Keys**    
    - Used for CLI/SDK.
    - RSA key pair (private + public).
    - Signs requests to prove identity.
3. **Auth Tokens**
    - Oracle-generated tokens.
    - Used when third-party tools don't support API signing (e.g., connecting to ADW from third-party clients).

# ðŸ›‚ **Authorization (AuthZ)** â€“ _"What are you allowed to do?"_

Done using **IAM policies**, which are human-readable statements that grant permissions.

## ðŸ’¡ **Policy Syntax**
![[Pasted image 20250725130619.png]]

- **Group**: Set of users (canâ€™t assign policies to individual users).
- **Verb** (Permission level):
    - `manage`: Full control (create/update/delete).
    - `use`: Read and limited actions (e.g., start/stop).
    - `read`: View only.
    - `inspect`: Metadata only.
- **Resource-type**: What the group can access (e.g., `all-resources`, `compute-instances`).
- **Location**: `tenancy` or specific `compartment`.

## ðŸ“‚ **Policy Scope**

- **Tenancy**: Global across all compartments.
- **Compartment**: Local to specific resources.

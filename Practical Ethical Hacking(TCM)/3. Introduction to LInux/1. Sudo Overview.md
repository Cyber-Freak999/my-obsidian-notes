The `sudo` command in Linux allows a user with appropriate privileges to execute commands as a superuser or another user. It is commonly used to perform administrative tasks that require elevated privileges. 

Please note that the availability and configuration of `sudo` can vary depending on the Linux distribution and the user's privileges. Additionally, the `sudo` command can be used for various other administrative tasks, such as editing system files, managing services, and executing critical commands.

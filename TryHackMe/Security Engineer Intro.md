# Why Organizations Need Security
As the digital era reshapes how organizations operate globally, it brings along significant challenges. While technology enhances collaboration, streamlines operations, and drives innovation, it also introduces risks—data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other cyber threats. These incidents frequently make headlines, underlining the critical need for digital protection.

Organizations face two choices: revert to outdated methods and forgo the benefits of modern tech, or embrace innovation while securing their digital infrastructure. The latter is the only viable path forward. Just as companies invest in securing physical assets, they must equally prioritize protecting digital assets to ensure business continuity and achieve their goals without disruption.

# The Role of a Security Engineer

To address these digital threats, organizations hire security engineers. These professionals are seen as the guardians of an organization’s digital environment. Their responsibilities typically include:
- Taking ownership of the organization’s overall cybersecurity posture.
- Minimizing cyber risks through proactive planning and rapid response strategies.
- Designing and implementing systems to detect, mitigate, and prevent security threats.
- Conducting regular security assessments to uncover vulnerabilities and apply effective mitigations.
- Building and maintaining secure, reliable network architectures and system infrastructures.
- Collaborating across teams to establish and enforce security protocols organization-wide.
## Qualifications for a Security Engineer

The role of a security engineer is broad and often shaped by the specific needs of each organization. In essence, a security engineer approaches complex security issues like an engineer—by breaking them down into manageable parts and solving them methodically. This means the day-to-day work can vary significantly.

Key qualifications organizations typically look for include:
- 0–2 years of experience in IT administration, technical support, networking, or security operations.
- A foundational understanding of operating systems, networking concepts, and basic programming.
- Familiarity with core security principles, particularly in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).
Security engineers are expected to be adaptable, analytical, and proactive in navigating evolving threat landscapes and securing organizational assets.

A well-structured pentest report is more than a technical document — it’s a **business asset** that helps developers, product owners, and security teams understand risks and take action. It should be **clear, factual, prioritized, and solution-oriented**.

## 📌 1. **Executive Summary**

This is for **non-technical stakeholders** (e.g., managers, executives). Keep it concise and high-level.

**Include:**

- **Project objectives** (e.g., “Assess the security of public and internal API endpoints”).
    
- **Summary of findings** (e.g., “5 critical, 3 high, 4 medium, 2 low-risk vulnerabilities identified”).
    
- **Overall risk posture** (e.g., "Moderate risk — critical issues found in auth and RBAC").
    
- **Positive highlights** (e.g., “Strong input validation on most endpoints”).
    

✅ _Goal:_ Help decision-makers quickly grasp the security risks and urgency without needing technical background.

## 🛑 2. **Scope**

Clearly define **what was tested** — and equally important, **what was not**.

**Include:**

- **Target environment(s):** Dev, staging, production
    
- **API components included:** Public/private APIs, microservices, auth servers
    
- **Testing window:** Dates and timeframes
    
- **Authentication levels tested:** Guest, user, admin roles (if applicable)
    
- **Out-of-scope exclusions:** IP ranges, endpoints, or functionality explicitly omitted
    

✅ _Goal:_ Prevent misunderstandings later and avoid scope creep questions from stakeholders.

## 🔬 3. **Methodology**

Detail your testing approach in a structured, transparent way.

**Include:**

- **Testing type:** Blackbox, greybox, or whitebox
    
- **Reference frameworks used:** OWASP API Security Top 10 (2019 & 2023), OWASP ASVS
    
- **Tools used:** Burp Suite, Postman, APIsec Scan, JWT.io, etc.
    
- **Authentication method:** OAuth2, API keys, session tokens
    
- **Techniques used:** Manual endpoint fuzzing, mass assignment tests, token replay, role escalation testing
    

✅ _Goal:_ Show clients that your process is professional, methodical, and standards-based.

## 🧨 4. **Findings (Vulnerabilities)**

This is the heart of your report. List **each vulnerability clearly and consistently**, one-by-one.

**For each issue, include:**

- **Title:** Clear, specific name (e.g., _Broken Object Level Authorization on `/api/orders/{id}`_)
    
- **Risk Rating:** CVSS v4.0 score (e.g., 8.6 High)
    
- **Description:** What the vulnerability is, in plain terms
    
- **Impact:** What an attacker could achieve if exploited
    
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Steps to reproduce with curl/Postman example
    
- **Evidence:** Screenshots, logs, intercepted requests
    
- **OWASP Mapping:** e.g., _OWASP API Security Top 10 - API1:2023_
    
- **Affected endpoints:** List or table of impacted URIs and methods
    
- **Likelihood & severity:** Add business context where relevant
    

✅ _Goal:_ Be thorough, but concise. Your clients should be able to understand and reproduce the issue without prior knowledge.

## 🛠️ 5. **Recommendations**

Offer **practical, actionable advice** to fix each issue.

**Include for each vulnerability:**

- **Remediation advice:** Technical steps to patch or reconfigure
    
- **Mitigation strategies:** If full remediation is delayed, what can reduce risk short-term?
    
- **Best practice links:** Reference OWASP or vendor documentation when helpful
    

**Optional extras:**

- General hardening tips for the API (e.g., rate limiting, logging, monitoring)
    
- Secure coding practices (e.g., how to avoid mass assignment vulnerabilities in Node.js)
    

✅ _Goal:_ Enable dev teams to **fix fast and smart** — avoid vague statements like “fix authorization logic.”

## 📊 6. **Conclusion**

Summarize the **overall security state of the API** based on the testing results.

**Include:**

- **Risk summary:** Total issues by severity
    
- **Security posture:** Weak, moderate, strong
    
- **Next steps:** Suggested follow-ups (e.g., retesting after fixes, continuous testing)
    
- **Final remarks:** Acknowledge improvements or positive design patterns observed
    

✅ _Goal:_ Wrap up the report with a clear sense of closure and direction.

## 🔒 Bonus Tips for a Great Pentest Report

### ✅ Include Evidence
- **Screenshots**, intercepted requests, and tokens make your findings **verifiable**.
- Use **red boxes/highlighting** to call out key info in screenshots.
### ✅ Use CVSS v4.0 for Risk Ratings
- Helps prioritize by **impact and exploitability**.
- Consider tagging **business impact** alongside CVSS scores for context.
### ✅ Maintain Neutral Tone
- Be factual, not alarmist.
- Avoid jargon — assume some readers aren’t technical.
### ✅ Highlight What’s Done Well
- Acknowledge things like:
    - “Rate limiting implemented on all auth endpoints.”
    - “JWTs have strong entropy and short lifetimes.”
    - “Input validation present on all query parameters.”
It builds trust and shows objectivity.

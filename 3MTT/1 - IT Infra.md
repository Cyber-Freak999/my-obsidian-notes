IT infrastructure refers to all the essential components businesses use to operate, including hardware, network elements, software, communication, and the physical facilities that house the equipment.
The five essential components of IT infrastructure are: Hardware (physical devices), Network Elements (routers, switches, servers), Software (applications), Communication (phone systems and services), and Facilities (physical locations).
Traditional IT infrastructure resides on-site, offering full control but requiring significant maintenance costs, while cloud-based infrastructure is hosted by a provider and accessed via the internet with benefits like affordability and scalability.
An optimal IT infrastructure is designed for high availability with minimal downtime, employing redundancy and failover plans to maintain continuous business operations during failures or disasters.
Network performance is improved by using low latency networks and bandwidth management to prioritize critical traffic such as VoIP calls, ensuring efficient data processing and minimal delays.
Servers are dedicated computers that provide services like web hosting, data storage, or email to multiple clients over a network, centralizing resources and operations.
Any computer can act as a server by running server software, but true servers use specialized hardware and operating systems to handle large workloads and many simultaneous connections reliably.
Server hardware differs from desktops by using processors like Intel Xeon that support multiprocessing, ECC RAM for error correction, larger RAM capacity, and features like hot-swappable drives and RAID configurations for reliability.
Server operating systems such as Windows Server or Linux are designed to be stable and run continuously, handling thousands of simultaneous connections and critical services without interruption.
Common server types include web servers (host websites), email servers (manage email sending and receiving), and database servers (store and retrieve data accessed by clients).

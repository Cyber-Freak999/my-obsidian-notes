90% of builders hide behind walls of text.

Clever tweets, long posts, fluffy emails.

Thousands of words skimmed, ignored, or deleted without a care.

Most know by now video converts better, but few ever hit record. No one likes seeing themselves on video.

That means an arbitrage opportunity.

Your face and your voice build trust faster than words on a screen can. Videos make communication more personal, more engaging.

They get more attention and more responses.

That's why videos work so well for things like outreach, pitches, and on-boarding.

Some are using crunchy, low-pro videos to sell their services and products 90% on autopilot.

Let's see what it means for internet entrepreneurs.

# Trends

Attention spans are shrinking.

We skim texts, skip ads, and scroll to the next thing.

Sub-90-second videos are the only things left that anyone has time for.

We’ll still watch a short video. In fact, we love a short video.

- 65% will watch a cold-video to the end if it’s under a minute
- Video messages get 26% more replies than text-only outreach
- Close rates jump 41% when proposals include videos

One video can build more rapport than weeks of back-and-forth emails. The more others resist video, the more yours stand out.

Videos can be your edge for every touch point:

- For cold outreach
- For pitching async offers
- For onboarding new clients
- For delighting new customers

Your words don’t need polish. They just need a face - you, talking to one person, with one clear point, in give or take one minute.

Today’s tools reduce the friction for starting to basically zero.

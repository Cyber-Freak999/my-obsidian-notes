A computer network is a system of interconnected devices called nodes that can create, send, receive, or store data, enabling communication and resource sharing.
Networking involves the design, construction, management, and operation of networks, ensuring devices can communicate efficiently and securely.
Networks can be wired or wireless and depend on hardware like switches, routers, and access points, along with software and firmware to manage and secure data flow.
Standard protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, and UDP/IP define rules for how data is formatted and transmitted across networks to ensure reliable communication.
The internet is a complex global network represented physically by underground wires like fiber optics and copper cables that connect computers and servers worldwide.
Data sent over the internet is broken down into small pieces called packets; these packets travel independently and are reassembled at their destination to form the original data.
Every device on the internet has a unique IP address that serves as its identifier, much like a postal address, allowing data to be routed correctly between devices.
Routers are specialized devices that guide data packets along their journey across the internet by forwarding them step-by-step toward their destination IP addresses.
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-friendly domain names like example.com into IP addresses, enabling browsers to locate and access websites.
DNS queries involve recursive lookups through a hierarchy of servers from root servers to authoritative name servers to resolve domain names efficiently and quickly.

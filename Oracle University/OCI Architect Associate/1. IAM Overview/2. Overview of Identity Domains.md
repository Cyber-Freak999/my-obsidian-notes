### TLDR

An **OCI Identity Domain** is a **logical container** for managing users, groups, apps, roles, and security settings. It enables:

- **Inbound Authentication & SSO** (social, federated, AD bridge, MFA, adaptive security).
- **Identity Store & Lifecycle Management** (user onboarding, provisioning, external directory sync).
- **Outbound Authentication & SSO** (integrations with SaaS, enterprise apps, VPNs, Linux hosts).
- **OCI Authorization** (IAM policies for resource access).  
    Use cases: employee access mgmt, partner access, consumer identities, and secure app integrations.

# What is an Identity Domain?

- Represents **user population** in OCI + associated **configs & security settings**.    
- Functions as a **self-contained IAM service**.
- Manages:
    - Users, Groups, Roles
    - Federation (SAML, OAuth)
    - Provisioning from external directories (e.g., Active Directory)
    - MFA, adaptive security
    - Application integrations (SSO, proxies, gateways).
## Features & Capabilities

1. **Inbound Authentication & SSO**    
    - Users authenticate into OCI IAM.
    - Methods:
        - Username/password, social login.
        - Federated login (SAML/OAuth) via **AD Bridge** or other identity providers.
        - Delegated authentication with AD.
        - MFA (email, OTP apps, security questions, passwordless).
        - Adaptive security (context-based authentication).
2. **Identity Store & Lifecycle Management**
    - Onboard/manage users from:
        - Console, CLI, API.
        - **AD Bridge** or **Provisioning Bridge**.
    - Application catalog (400+ pre-configured apps).
    - Supports:
        - Role assignment, group membership.
        - Provisioning/de-provisioning.
        - Synchronization between on-prem & cloud.
3. **Outbound Authentication & SSO**
    - After authentication, provide **SSO access** to:
        - SaaS apps (e.g., Salesforce, Workday).
        - Enterprise apps.
        - VPNs, Linux hosts.
    - Protocols: SAML, OpenID Connect.
    - Proxies/gateways for apps that donâ€™t support modern protocols.
4. **OCI Authorization**
    - Uses IAM **policies** to control access to OCI resources (compute, storage, networking).
    - Scoped to **compartments** or **tenancy**.
## Use Cases

- **Employees:** Centralized access across on-prem and cloud apps.
- **Partners:** Isolated domain for supply-chain apps.
- **Consumers:** Separate domain for public-facing apps with tailored authentication.

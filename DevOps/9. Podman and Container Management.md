Podman is a native open-source tool that does not choose daemons or background processes. It is design to facilitate the search, construction, sharing and deployment of applications using open and continuous initiatives. 
One key key feature is that it does not require a daemon process for controlling the instances of each container. 
Other features include:
- Root-less: It allows us to lift containers without having root privileges.
- Daemon-less: Podman does not need to raise a single daemon of many services to work.
- Pods: Podman coined the term pod as we know it with Kubernetes so that we could lift pods from one or more containers and isolate them from the pods. Pods are a group of containers with shared storage and network resources.
- Command line: The commands are equivalent to those of Docker, and there are no differences.
# Container Orchestration
A container orchestrator is responsible for the following tasks:
- deployment and raised automatic container-based services
- self-scaling and load balancing
- control of the "health" of each container
- secrets management in parameters and configurations

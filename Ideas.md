Companies are now building custom AI assistants tailored to their codebases, and developers are treating prompt engineering as a core skill. The focus is on creating reliable, secure pipelines for AI-assisted development while maintaining code quality and security standards.

**Edge Computing Goes Mainstream**

Edge computing isn't just for IoT anymore. We're seeing a massive shift toward edge-first architectures, with developers optimizing applications to process data closer to the source. This means new patterns for handling state, different approaches to caching, and innovative solutions for edge-cloud synchronization. The killer feature? Drastically reduced latency and better user experiences.

**Green Tech Gets Serious**

Sustainability isn't just a buzzword ‚Äì it's becoming a key metric in software development. Teams are now measuring their application's carbon footprint alongside traditional performance metrics. We're seeing the rise of energy-efficient algorithms, carbon-aware computing practices, and new tools for measuring and optimizing the environmental impact of our applications.

**WebAssembly Beyond Browsers**

WASM is breaking free from its browser origins. Developers are using it to build high-performance server-side applications, create cross-platform tools, and even power edge computing solutions. The ability to write code once and run it nearly anywhere with near-native performance is creating exciting new possibilities for application architecture.

**Vector-First Data**

As AI capabilities become core to applications, traditional databases are giving way to vector-first storage solutions. Developers are learning to work with embedding models, similarity search, and vector indexes as fundamental skills. The rise of multimodal applications (handling text, images, and audio together) is pushing us to rethink how we store and query data.

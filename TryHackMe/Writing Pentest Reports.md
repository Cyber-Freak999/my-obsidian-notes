# The Anatomy of a Pentest Report
Every good report is built around a clear, logical format. This structure helps you present findings in a way that makes sense to both business and technical stakeholders. Before we can dive into the anatomy of a good report, we first need to understand the different audiences that your report should aim to address:

- **Technical Stakeholders** - Ultimately, your report aims to aid the technical team in understanding the root cause of the discovered vulnerabilities and what steps they will need to take to remediate them. If you performed a pentest of a web application, this will most likely be the developers of the application. If you assess a network, your report will most likely need to provide guidance to the IT Support team. As this is the most crucial audience, you would usually find that around 70-90% of your report is specifically aimed towards this audience.
- **Security Stakeholders** - Usually, it isn't the developers or IT support team that requests the pentest. More than likely, the organisation's security function was involved in ensuring a security assessment was performed as part of the go-live process. This team won't be directly responsible for remediating the vulnerabilities but will be working very closely with those that are. As such, sections of the report will have to provide guidance to the security personnel to better help them prioritise remediation efforts and make sound judgement calls on which risks have to be addressed before the system goes live and which can be accepted. While this team will usually review your entire report, at least 10-20% of the report should speak to this audience directly.
- **Business Stakeholders** - _"Security must **enable** business, not fight against it."_ A common phrase you would hear in the pentesting field. Usually, someone other than the developers and security personnel are paying for the assessment. Furthermore, these individuals are usually much less technical and more business-driven. A key piece of your report needs to speak to this audience to help them better understand the business impact of your findings. What could the actual real-life impact be if they choose not to remediate the vulnerabilities? At least 5-10% of your report should speak to this audience in a manner that is abstracted from the technical work.

## Sections of the Report
Now that we understand the audience our report needs to speak to, let's take a look at the three main sections that you would require:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Section**|**Target Audience**|**Description**|
|**Summary**|Business & Security Stakeholders|This is the high-level view of the assessment. It explains what was tested, what was found, and why it matters — all in business terms. In certain cases, you would create an executive summary that speaks directly to the business stakeholders only in business terms and then a more detailed Findings and Recommendation section to aid security stakeholders in their prioritisation efforts.|
|**Vulnerability Write-Ups**|Technical Stakeholders|This is the technical heart of the report. Each issue discovered during the test gets its own write-up, which will include details on the vulnerability, how it can be replicated, and the actions required for remediation.|
|**Appendices**|Security Stakeholders|The appendices provide supporting details that don’t fit in the main report. This could include elements such as the detailed testing scope, methodology, or artefacts that were left over from testing. These appendices are usually used by the security stakeholders to help them better understand the coverage that was achieved during the engagement and the next steps that would be required once remediation has been performed.|

## Why this matters
A well-structured report makes it easier for your audience to take action. Business leaders can assess risk, and technical teams can start remediation. If your report lacks structure, even good findings might be ignored. In the next tasks, we’ll closely examine each of these sections.

## Summary of a Summary

In some cases, a single summary section is not enough to meet the needs of both business and security stakeholders. When this happens, it’s common to break the summary into two parts:

- **Executive Summary** - Written for business stakeholders, this version avoids technical jargon and focuses on business risk. It highlights the overall security posture and key concerns in a way that helps business stakeholders understand the impact of the findings and the actions that should be taken immediately.
- **Findings & Recommendations** - Written for the security team, this section details common vulnerability themes and attack chains. Vulnerabilities have risk ratings that are measured in isolation as if none of the other vulnerabilities existed. However, you may often find that the combination of two or more lower-risk vulnerabilities could still have high business impact. This is the section where you are able to highlight this to security stakeholders, helping them reprioritise remediation to address these issues. This section often draws links between issues and identifies systemic problems, allowing security stakeholders to use this information to help developers avoid future mistakes.
## Summary Structure
Regardless of whether you split the summary into two or keep it as one, a good summary should cover the following:

- **Overview** - What was tested? What type of system or application is it? What were the goals of the assessment? What was the scope, and how much coverage could be achieved?
- **Results** - What did the assessment uncover? Was the system secure? If not, what categories of issues were found?
- **Impact** - What is the real-world impact if the issues remain unaddressed? How could the system be exploited by a real-life threat actor?
- **Remediation Direction** - At a high level, what actions should the organisation take next? Does this require major investment, or are the issues mostly quick fixes?

The summary sets the tone for the entire report. If it’s too technical, business stakeholders will disengage. If it’s too vague, security teams won’t know what to do next. Knowing how and when to split the summary ensures your message reaches the right people, and leads to real action.

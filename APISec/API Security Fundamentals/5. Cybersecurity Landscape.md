APIs, unlike web applications, lack standardised interfaces, making security testing challenging. The solution is to implement automated API security testing early in the development process (shift left). This involves using tools to identify vulnerabilities like injection flaws, weak authentication, and outdated libraries before deployment. By automating this process, organisations can ensure every release undergoes rigorous security checks, preventing vulnerabilities from reaching production.

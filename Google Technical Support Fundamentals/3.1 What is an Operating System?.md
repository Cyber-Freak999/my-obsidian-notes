The Whole package that manages our computer's resources and lets you interact with it.

User Space <=> Kernel <=> Hardware

# Parts
- Kernel - Process Manager, Memory Manager, File Manager, I/O Manager
- User Space - Applications

# Common OS
- Windows
- Macs
- Linux - Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat
- [Chrome OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS)(Not commonly used)

# Files and File System
File Handling - Data, Metadata, File system

Windows - NTFS
Linux - ext4

[ReFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReFS)

Data is written in the form of data.
Block storage improves faster handling of data because the data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker.
It is also better for utilizing the storage space.

Metadata - It tells everything to be known about the file. It also shows what type of file it is.

# Process Management
When a program is being run, processes are created.
The kernel creates processes, efficiently schedule them, and manages how process are terminated.
Processes are run in time slices in concurrency*
This gives the impression of programs running simultaneously.

Time Slice - A very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution.

# Memory Management
When processes are run, they are loaded in memory so that the cpu can read them and load them quickly. Compared to drives, memory is smaller in size. To get more memory, virtual memory is created.

Virtual Memory - The combination of hard drive space and RAM

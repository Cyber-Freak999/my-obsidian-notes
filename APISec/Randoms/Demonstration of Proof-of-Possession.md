**DPoP (Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession)** strengthens token usage by binding access tokens to a specific client and request, protecting against token replay and theft. Here‚Äôs how it works step-by-step:

---

### üîë **1. Key Pair Generation**

The client generates a **private/public key pair**, typically using elliptic curve algorithms like `ES256`. The **private key** stays securely on the client, while the **public key** is embedded in DPoP JWTs and may be referenced in the token itself.

---

### üìÑ **2. DPoP Proof JWT Creation**

For every request that includes an access token, the client must generate a short-lived signed JWT called the **DPoP proof**. This JWT contains:

- `htu`: **HTTP URI** of the request (e.g., `https://api.example.com/data`)
    
- `htm`: **HTTP method** (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
    
- `jti`: Unique JWT ID (nonce-like, to prevent replay)
    
- `iat`: Issued-at timestamp (usually valid for 5 minutes max)
    
- `cnf`: (Optional) Confirmation claim ‚Äî thumbprint of the public key
    
- **Header** includes the public key in JWK format
    

This JWT is signed with the **private key**, proving the client possesses it.

---

### üì® **3. Sending the Request**

The client sends **two headers**:

- `Authorization: DPoP <access_token>`
    
- `DPoP: <signed DPoP JWT>`
    

This tells the resource server:

- Here's the token I'm using
    
- Here‚Äôs proof I own the private key associated with it
    
- And this proof is tied to _this specific request_ (method + URI)
    

---

### üîç **4. Server-Side Validation**

The resource server does the following:

- Verifies the **access token** (as usual).
    
- Parses the **DPoP header** and verifies:
    
    - Signature using the public key in the DPoP JWT
        
    - URI (`htu`) and method (`htm`) match the actual request
        
    - JWT `jti` hasn't been used before (to prevent replay)
        
    - Token's confirmation claim (`cnf`) references the **same** key used to sign the DPoP proof
        
    - `iat` is recent (within a few minutes)
        

If all checks pass, the request is accepted. Otherwise, it's rejected.

---

### üß† Why Use DPoP?

- **Token Theft Protection**: Tokens stolen from logs, memory, or MITM attacks can't be reused without the private key.
    
- **Sender Binding**: Enforces that only the rightful client can use the token.
    
- **Request Binding**: Even if a DPoP JWT is replayed, it only works for the _original method+URI_.
    
- **No Need for TLS Client Certificates**: Unlike Mutual TLS, DPoP is **application-layer**, more flexible in environments like browsers or mobile apps.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Considerations

- Keep the DPoP JWT lifetime **short (1-5 mins)**.
    
- Use strong algorithms like `ES256`; avoid `none` or weak signatures.
    
- Prevent JWT `jti` reuse (replay detection) ‚Äî ideally store recent IDs in a short-term cache.
    
- Validate both token and DPoP JWT in every call.

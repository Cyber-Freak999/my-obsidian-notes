# What is Generative AI (GenAI)?

- **Generative AI** is a type of AI (specifically deep learning) focused on _creating_ new content rather than just analyzing or predicting.
- It can generate **Text** (e.g., articles, code, stories), **Images**, **Music**, **Video**, **Other data formats**        
## **How it works**
- It learns _patterns_ from large datasets (e.g., thousands of dog images).	
- Then it uses those patterns to **create new content** that reflects what it learned—like generating a new dog image it hasn't seen before.
- Importantly, it doesn't copy—_it generates new, original outputs based on learned structure_.

# 🤖 **Generative AI vs Traditional Machine Learning**

|Feature|Traditional ML|Generative AI|
|---|---|---|
|**Goal**|Classify or predict|Generate new content|
|**Data requirement**|Labeled data (e.g., picture + label “dog”)|Often uses _unlabeled_ data|
|**Output**|Label or value (e.g., “dog”)|Text, images, video, etc.|
|**Example Use**|Predicting house prices, detecting spam|Writing articles, drawing pictures, composing music|

- **ML Example**: Give the model a photo of an animal → it predicts "dog" or "cat".    
- **GenAI Example**: Give the model a prompt → it creates a _new image of a dog_ from scratch.

## **How Does Training Differ?**

- **ML**: Supervised learning = input data + known output labels.
- **GenAI**: Often trained in an _unsupervised_ or _self-supervised_ way (learns structure without needing labels), then can be **fine-tuned** later for specific tasks using labeled data.

# **Types of Generative AI Models**

1. **Text-based Models**    
    - Generate: text, dialogue, code, summaries, articles.
    - Examples: ChatGPT, Claude, LLaMA.
2. **Multimodal Models**    
    - Handle and generate _multiple_ data types (text, images, audio, video).
    - Can interpret or create across modalities (e.g., generate images from text prompts).
    - Examples: OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini, Meta’s I-JEPA.
# **Applications of GenAI**

Generative AI is transforming nearly every domain
- **Creative industries**: Art, music, writing.
- **Healthcare**: Drug discovery, radiology image synthesis, early diagnosis.
- **Education**: Personalized tutoring, content generation.
- **Marketing**: Ad copy, product descriptions, campaign automation
- **Software Development**: Code generation, bug detection.
- **Entertainment**: Game design, visual effects, virtual actors.

>  GenAI is not just a novelty—it’s becoming a productivity engine and an innovation accelerator across industries.

## Pretraining vs Fine-tuning

- **Pretraining**: Model learns from huge amounts of raw data without labels.
- **Fine-tuning**: Later, the model is adjusted (trained again) on smaller, labeled datasets to specialize in tasks (e.g., summarizing legal documents).

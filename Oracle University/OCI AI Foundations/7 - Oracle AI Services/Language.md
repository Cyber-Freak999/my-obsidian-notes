# OCI Language

**OCI Language** is a fully managed service from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) that **analyses unstructured text** using pre-trained models. It requires **no data science expertise**, making it accessible to developers and business users.

# Core Capabilities

1. **Language Detection**
    - Automatically detects the **language** of the input text.
    - Supports **75 languages** (from **Afrikaans to Welsh**).
2. **Entity Recognition**
    - Identifies **named entities** in the text (e.g., people, places, dates, etc.).
    - Recognises **14 entity types**, including:
        - Names
        - Organisations
        - Emails
        - Phone numbers
        - Currency
        - Locations
        - Dates and times
3. **Sentiment Analysis**
    - Detects the **emotional tone** (positive, negative, neutral, or mixed) of text.
    - Works at multiple levels:
        - **Overall sentiment**
        - **Per sentence sentiment**            
        - **Aspect-based sentiment**            
            > Example:  
            > "The food was great, but the service sucked."
            - _Food_ → Positive
            - _Service_ → Negative                
4. **Key Phrase Extraction**    
    - Pulls out the **most important phrases or concepts** in the text.        
    - Helps summarise the **main topics or ideas**.        
5. **Text Classification**    
    - Categorises the content into **topics or domains**.        
    - Based on a taxonomy of **600+ categories and subcategories**.  
        (e.g., Sports > Football, Technology > Cloud Computing)        

# How It's Useful

- **Automates** language understanding tasks like tagging, routing, summarising.   
- Integrates easily into **chatbots, customer service, feedback analysis**, and **document classification**.    
- Saves time by eliminating the need for manual labeling or building custom ML models.

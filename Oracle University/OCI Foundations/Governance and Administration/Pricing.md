# OCI Pricing Overview

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers **simple, transparent, and competitive pricing**. Key highlights:

## ‚úÖ **Three Main Pricing Models**:

1. **Pay As You Go (PAYG)**    
    - No upfront commitment
    - Charged only for what you use
    - Suitable for flexibility and dynamic workloads
2. **Annual Universal Credits (AUC)**
    - Commit to a 12-month spend
    - Get **discounted rates**
    - Extra usage beyond credits is billed at PAYG rates
    - Great for predictable workloads and cost savings
3. **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**
    - Use your existing on-prem licenses in the cloud
    - Reduces total cost of ownership
    - Useful for Oracle software workloads
# üßÆ **Factors That Impact Pricing**

|Factor|Description|
|---|---|
|**Resource Size**|Larger compute, memory, or storage costs more|
|**Resource Type**|VMs, bare metal, and serverless all have different price points|
|**Licensing Model**|BYOL pricing is different and often cheaper for eligible services|
|**Data Transfer**|Key cost factor, especially for high-bandwidth workloads|

## üåç **Unique to OCI**

- **Flat Pricing Globally**    
    - Same pricing across all regions
    - No ‚Äúlocation-based‚Äù price discrepancies like with AWS or Azure

# üì° **Data Transfer Costs**

- **Free Inbound Data**    
    - As per industry standard
- **Free Inter-AD Transfer** (within the same region)
    - Encourages High Availability (HA) deployments
    - Other cloud providers often charge for this
- **Low Outbound Costs**
    - OCI charges **up to 10x less** than competitors for egress traffic
    - Huge savings for data-heavy applications

# üßæ Additional Notes

- **Consumption-Based Pricing** (e.g., for serverless like OCI Functions):    
    - You're only billed when the function runs
    - More granular than PAYG (which might bill for idle VM time)
- **Monthly Universal Credits** also exist but are less emphasized in this lesson‚Äîcheck OCI documentation for details

- Logic

# Scenario 1: Application Layer DDOS
Bots coordinate bursts of requests to an endpoint, often triggered when users unknowingly click on crafted links exploiting vulnerabilities like **XSS** that cause requests to reflect to your server.

**How to mitigate:**
- Require **authentication** to verify users before processing requests.
- Apply throttling based on user identity or client fingerprints to control request volume.
- Use **CAPTCHA** challenges to block or slow down automated bot traffic.

# Scenario 2: Impatient User
This user repeatedly sends identical requests in quick succession, often because they’re impatient or trying to speed things up (like clicking a button multiple times).

**How to manage:**  
Implement a **browser-side debounce**, which delays sending the request until the user stops triggering the action for a short period. This reduces duplicate requests hitting the server and helps control the rate without blocking legitimate users harshly.
# Scenario 3: The Brute Force
Attackers try repeated attempts to guess one-time passwords (OTPs), enumerate users, or scrape data by making many requests.
The user enumeration can be figured out by the difference in response time for a valid user and an invalid user or verbose errors like "The password for this user is not correct"

**How to manage:**
- Count attempts **within a user session** to detect rapid retries.
- Use a **client signature** (like IP + device fingerprint) to track attempts across sessions.
- Apply temporary blocks when thresholds are exceeded to prevent abuse.
- Use email to check for valid user ie "An email has been sent to this user". With that, a valid user should receive an email.
# Scenario 4: The Budget Server
Certain API endpoints or resources require heavy processing, complex calculations, large data retrievals, or trigger costly scaling (e.g., spinning up additional server instances, database queries that consume high I/O or CPU). Without limits, these calls can quickly rack up hosting costs, especially if abused or accessed too frequently.
**Why it matters:**
- Cloud providers often charge based on CPU time, memory, bandwidth, or concurrent resource usage.
- Unexpected or abusive high-volume requests can cause your bill to skyrocket.
- Even legitimate high traffic can cause budget overruns if not managed properly.

**Mitigation strategies:**

1. **Limit concurrency:**
    - Restrict how many simultaneous requests a user or client can make to expensive endpoints.
    - This prevents resource exhaustion and spreading out the load evenly over time.
2. **Limit query scope and complexity:**
    - Impose maximum limits on query sizes, filters, or data ranges.
    - For example, limit pagination size, restrict complex joins or heavy aggregation queries.
    - This reduces the computational load per request.
3. **Implement usage quotas:**
    - Define daily/hourly/monthly quotas per user, API key, or IP address.
    - When users hit their quota, block or throttle further requests.
    - This controls total consumption and avoids runaway costs.
4. **Prioritize requests or tier users:**
    - Allow higher quotas or concurrency for premium users.
    - Defer or queue less critical requests during peak loads.
5. **Monitor and alert:**
    - Track usage and costs continuously.
    - Alert when usage approaches budget thresholds so you can act proactively.

# Extra Tips for Effective Rate Limiting
- **Avoid using SQL operations to manage throttling**  
    (Database calls for throttling can cause performance bottlenecks and increase latency.) 
- **Avoid disk operations**  
    (File reads/writes slow down request handling and reduce scalability.)
- **Include IP address along with user identity**  
    (This helps detect and limit abuse from shared accounts or distributed clients.)
- **Use caching where appropriate**  
    (For repeated identical queries, serve from cache to reduce load and improve response times.)

# Example: Throttle and Cache Solution for an API Endpoint

## **Scenario:**  
You have an API endpoint `/getUserData` that returns user profile data. The endpoint can be expensive because it queries multiple databases and performs some calculations.

## Step 1: Throttling

- **Goal:** Prevent users from making too many requests in a short time, protecting your backend from overload.
    
- **Implementation:**
    
    - Limit each user (identified by user ID + IP) to **10 requests per minute**.
        
    - If a user exceeds this, respond with HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) and an appropriate message.
        
- **How:**
    
    - Use an in-memory store like Redis to keep track of request counts with expiration timers (e.g., increment count on each request, reset every minute).
        
    - Reject requests exceeding the threshold.
## Step 2: Caching

- **Goal:** Avoid repeated expensive processing for identical requests.
    
- **Implementation:**
    
    - Cache the response data for a given user for a short period, say **30 seconds**.
        
    - When a request for `/getUserData` comes in, first check the cache for that user’s data.
        
    - If cached data exists, return it immediately without hitting the database or running heavy logic.
        
    - If not cached, process the request normally, store the response in cache, and then return it.
        
- **How:**
    
    - Use Redis or an in-memory cache keyed by user ID or a hash of the request parameters.
## Benefits of Combining Both
- **Throttling** limits abusive or excessive usage, protecting backend resources.
- **Caching** reduces load and response time for frequent identical requests, improving user experience and lowering costs.

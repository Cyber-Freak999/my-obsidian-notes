- Last Resort
- Relies on social engineering

### Working Principle
- Start a fake AP with the same name as the target network
- Disconnect a client
- Wait for them to connect to the fake AP
- Automatically display a page asking for network key

There's no need for guessing

### Drawbacks
- Users have to connect to the fake AP
- They have to enter their WPA key into the webpage

# BIOS
BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System, is the first software your computer runs when you turn it on. It helps to check the health and functionality of your hardware components, and it initiates the boot process of your operating system.

BIOS is stored on a ROM (Read-Only Memory) chip and is independent of the operating system. It has two main modes: UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) and Legacy.

When you turn on your computer, the BIOS performs a Power-On Self-Test (POST) to check the system's hardware and make sure everything is functioning correctly. If the POST encounters any issues, it will either halt the boot process or issue an error message.

If a hardware component fails POST and needs to be returned to the manufacturer, a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) is required. An RMA allows customers to return defective products to the manufacturer for repair or replacement.
# UEFI vs Legacy
UEFI is capable of providing faster boot times and support for drives larger than 2.2TB, whereas Legacy mode is used for older hardware that doesn't support UEFI. It's also important to note that some older operating systems may not support UEFI, hence the need for Legacy mode.

When selecting between UEFI and Legacy, it's crucial to consider the type of hardware and operating system you're using. Legacy mode might not support some of the newer hardware enhancements and is generally slower compared to UEFI. On the other hand, UEFI might not be compatible with some older operating systems or hardware.

In addition to the boot speed and disk support, UEFI also offers additional features like secure boot, which can protect the system's pre-boot process against bootkit attacks. It can also support network functions, allowing the system to perform tasks like remote troubleshooting and configuration.

In contrast, Legacy BIOS lacks these additional features and might be susceptible to bootkit attacks. It also doesn't support network functions, limiting its capabilities for remote management.

In conclusion, while Legacy mode might be suitable for older systems, UEFI is generally the more powerful and versatile option, offering faster boot times, larger disk support, and additional security and network features.

# Power on Self Test(POST)
POST, or Power-On Self-Test, is a system in computers that checks for the required functionality of the hardware components and ensures they are working correctly before it boots up the operating system. It checks for the functionality of important components such as the CPU, memory, and disk drives. If a component fails the POST, the computer will not boot up, and it may beep or display a text error message indicating what component failed.
# Mobile Display Types
 In your IT job role, you should have a basic understanding of the technology behind modern displays, as well as their common uses, positive features, and negative flaws. The top two technologies used in mobile system displays are Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED).

## Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
LCDs use liquid crystal technology. Liquid crystals have the properties of both a liquid and a solid. The crystals can be aligned in a variety of patterns and manipulated with electricity. How the liquid crystals are arranged and manipulated inside display panels affects refresh rates, image quality, and display performance. LCDs require backlighting, often provided by LEDs. Displays that need backlighting are also called non-emissive or passive displays. The backlighting unit (BLU) requires extra space, which makes LCD panels thicker and less flexible than other displays. Polarizers on either side of the liquid crystal layer control the path of the backlight to ensure the light is aimed toward the user.

The following are common LCD display types used for mobile devices:

### In-Plane Switching (IPS)
- **How it works:** In IPS displays, the liquid crystals are aligned horizontally to the screen. Electricity is passed between the ends of the crystals to control their behavior.
- **Uses:** IPS technology is used in touch screen displays and high-end monitors. They are often used for design, photography, video/film editing, animation, movies, and other media. They can also be used for games that rely on color accuracy and wide viewing angles, as opposed to speed.
- **Positives:** IPS displays provide vibrant colors, high quality graphics, and wide viewing areas. Additionally, they offer excellent color reproduction, accuracy, and contrast.
- **Negatives:** IPS displays are expensive. They have low refresh rates and slow response times. However, response times have been improving as the IPS technology evolves. IPS displays can be affected by “IPS Glow”, where the backlight is visible from side viewing angles.
### Twisted Nematic (TN)
Twisted Nematic (TN) is the earliest LCD technology that is still in use today. The term nematic, which means “threadlike,” is used to describe the appearance of the molecules inside the liquid.
- **How it works:** In TN displays, the liquid crystals are twisted. When voltage is applied, the crystals will untwist to change the angle of the light they transmit.
- **Uses:** TN displays are appropriate for basic business use (e.g., email, document, and spreadsheet applications). They are also used for games that need rapid display response times.
- **Positives:** TN displays are low cost, easy to produce, have excellent refresh rates, response times, and resolutions. They are versatile and can be manufactured for any size and/or shape.
- **Negatives:** TN displays have narrow viewing angles, low image quality, color distortion, and poor color accuracy and contrast.
### VA-Vertical Alignment
- **How it works:** In VA displays, the liquid crystal molecules are vertically aligned. They tilt when electricity passes through them.
- **Uses:** VA displays are intended for general purpose. Provides mid-range performance for graphic work, movies, and TV.
- **Positives:** VA displays offergreat contrast, deep black shades, and fast response times. They are mid-range quality for refresh rates, image quality, viewing angle, and color reproduction.
- **Negatives:** On VA displays, motion blur and ghosting occurs with fast-motion visuals.
## Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED)
OLEDs are diodes that emit light using organic (carbon-based) materials when electricity is passed through the diodes. Displays that are able to convert electricity into light are called emissive or active displays.
- **How it works:** The basic structure of an OLED display consists of an emissive layer placed between a cathode (which injects electrons) and an anode (which removes electrons). Electricity enters through the cathode layer, passes into the emissive layer and conductive layer to create light, then out through the anode layer.
- **Uses:** OLED display technology can be used in foldable smartphones, rollable TVs, as backlighting in LCD TVs, for gaming, and inside VR headsets.
- **Positives:** OLED displays deliver excellent picture quality, wide viewing angles, infinite contrast, fast response rate, and brilliant colors with true blacks. They are energy efficient, simpler to make, and much thinner than LCDs. OLED panels can be built to be flexible and even rollable.
- **Negatives**: OLED displays are sensitive to light and moisture. Blue LEDs degrade faster than other LED colors causing color distortion over time. They are also prone to image retention and burn-in.
### Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED)
Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED) and Super AMOLED are recent technologies used in smartphone displays.
- **How it works:** AMOLED displays are a type of OLED panel that uses active matrix technology. Active-matrix displays have active capacitors arranged in a matrix with thin film transistors (TFTs). This technology enables the control of each individual pixel for rapid state changes, including changing brightness and color. AMOLEDs have touchscreen functions integrated into the screen.
- **Uses:** AMOLED and Super AMOLED panels are used in high-end mobile devices, flat screen monitors, curved screens, and touchscreens.
- **Positives:** AMOLED displays offer a high picture quality and fast response time. Color and brightness are consistent across the screen. Fast-moving images and motion are displayed clearly without blurring or ghosting. Super AMOLED panels can display a wider range of colors with enhanced contrast, which makes them easy to view in a wider variety of lighting conditions.
- **Negatives:** AMOLED displays have the same problems as OLED displays (listed above) plus AMOLED panels can be difficult and expensive to manufacture.
### Inorganic mini-LEDs (mLEDs)
Inorganic mini-LEDs (mLEDs) are a next-generation, emissive display technology.

- **How it works:** Mini-LED displays work the same way that OLED displays work, but the individual LED size is much smaller at approximately 50-60 micrometers.
- **Uses:** Mini-LED displays are used for LCD backlighting in smartphones, public information displays, signage, electronics, vehicle displays, and more. Mini-LEDs are also the tech behind “Liquid Retina XDR” screens.
- **Positives:** Mini-LED displays offer ultra high luminance, superior HDR fineness, long lifetimes, thin panels, and are readable in sunlight. They are also less expensive than micro-LED displays.
- **Negatives:** Mini-LED displays, when used as LCD backlighting, are limited by the properties of LCD technology. Mini-LED displays for mobile devices are more expensive than OLED displays.

### Inorganic micro-LEDs (μLEDs)

Micro-LEDs (μLEDs) are also emissive, next-generation displays.

- **How it works:** Micro-LED displays work the same way that OLED displays work, but the individual LED size is extremely small at 15 micrometers.
- **Uses:** Micro-LED displays can be used in smartphones, AR/VR headsets, wearables, public information displays, wall-sized TVs, vehicle displays, and more.
- **Positives:** Micro-LED displaysoffer superior performances across virtually all common display features, such as brightness, reaction speeds, power consumption, durability, color gamut, stability, viewing angles, HDR, contrast, refresh rates, transparency, seamless connectivity, and more. Micro-LED displays are readable in sunlight and have sensor integration capability.
- **Negatives:** Micro-LED displays are expensive to manufacture and are not yet ready for mass production.****

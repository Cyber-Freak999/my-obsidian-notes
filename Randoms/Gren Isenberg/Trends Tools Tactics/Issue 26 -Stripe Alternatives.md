Payments shouldn’t freeze at international borders.

But if you’re outside the USA, they often do.

_“Card declined”  
“Country not supported”  
“Transaction blocked in seller's region”_

Each rejection costs real money. Each failed transaction sends potential customers looking elsewhere.

For many international founders, it can be rough trying to sell online.

- Limited banking options
- Complex tax requirements
- Payment processors that treat international merchants like suspects

Thankfully, Stripe isn't the only answer anymore.

There are platforms handling payments, taxes, and currencies for founders worldwide.

Let's explore what this means for internet entrepreneurs.
# Trends - Merchant of Record Platforms
The global online market is due to hit [$6.9 trillion this year](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4ugk6kzqlavhx57r8mb6h6pw5wgghl/n2hohvhvg8r2rgb6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueWFndWFyYS5jby9nbG9iYWwtZWNvbW1lcmNlLXNhbGVzLWdyb3d0aC8=), with cross-border sales growing at twice the rate of domestic e-commerce.

While US entrepreneurs can click a few buttons to start collecting payments, international builders face a maze of barriers. Try selling digital products from Venezuela or Bali and watch payment processors freeze your funds without warning or recourse.

That's why Merchant-of-Record (MoR) platforms are taking off.

Think of an MoR as your business passport – one that never expires and works in (almost) every country.

Traditional payment processors like Stripe and PayPal move money between some countries.

MoRs handle the entire transaction stack:

- Payment methods (not just credit cards)
- Currency conversions
- Payment disputes
- Fraud protection
- All the tax stuff

For non-US and US founders alike, these platforms act as the legal seller of your products, removing the biggest roadblock in selling to a global audience.

You build and deliver. Your MoR handles the logistics.

Set it up once, sell anywhere.

# Tactics
1) _**Set up a MoR payment link**_
	**What:** Create one checkout link that works for customers in any country.
	
	**Why:** A global checkout removes friction for international buyers. When customers see their preferred payment methods, [conversion rates jump 30%](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4ugk6kzqlavhx57r8mb6h6pw5wgghl/reh8hohm72xkx5i2/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BsaXRpdC5jb20vYmxvZy9jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLWNvbnZlcnNpb24vcGF5bWVudC1tZXRob2RzLWFuZC10aGUtaW1wYWN0LW9uLXlvdXItd2Vic2l0ZXMtY29udmVyc2lvbi1yYXRlcy8jOn46dGV4dD1CeSUyMGNob29zaW5nJTIwdGhlJTIwcmlnaHQlMjBwYXltZW50LGFzJTIwYXJlJTIwaW5zdGFsbG1lbnQlMjBwYXltZW50JTIwcGxhbnMu).
	
	**How:**
	
	1. Sign up for Paddle or Lemon Squeezy
	2. Fill in your product details (name, price, description, image)
	3. Copy the payment link or embed code they give you

2) _**Activate global-friendly pricing**_
	**What:** Auto-adjust your prices based on where your customer lives.
	
	**Why:** One price doesn't work everywhere. What costs pocket change in the US might be a day's wage elsewhere. Global-friendly pricing can open you up to sell in markets you'd otherwise miss.
	
	**How:**
	
	1. In your MoR dashboard, find the "Pricing" or "Checkout" settings
	2. Turn on automatic currency conversion (usually a toggle)
	3. In Paddle: Go to "Country Pricing" and set specific prices for key markets
	4. In Lemon Squeezy: Use "Pay What You Want" with minimums for flexible pricing
	
	**Tip:** Different markets have different "attractive price points" that convert better - ¥999 vs ¥1000, £50 vs £49. Set accordingly.

3) _**Sell worldwide without a US company**_
	**What:** Use MoR platforms to legally sell globally without incorporating overseas.
	
	**Why:** Setting up companies in multiple countries can cost $5K+ per market with months of paperwork. MoR platforms handle the legal and tax burden so you can test markets before spending big money to expand.
	
	**How:**
	
	1. Verify your identity and business details with your MoR
	2. Add your home bank account in "Payout Settings"
	3. Turn on automatic tax collection for VAT, GST, and sales tax
	4. Set your payout schedule
	
	**Tip:** Track which payment methods are most popular in different regions – this data is gold for marketing.

Building an online business is a lonely journey.

It’s easy to fall into the trap of taking everything on yourself when getting started.

You're putting in hard work to carve out a space for your dream to grow. Not only are you working alone, you probably don’t even know anyone doing the same thing.

Truth is, trying to navigate entrepreneurship alone can come with some serious hidden costs.

# **3 hidden costs holding back too many solo entrepreneurs and creators:**
## **Hidden cost #1: Wasted time and effort**

Trying to figure everything out on your own can be a major time suck. Without guidance from experienced mentors or peers, you're more likely to make avoidable mistakes.

_When you go it alone, every mistake is a lesson learned the hard way._

## **Hidden cost #2: Limited network**

Flying solo means missing out on valuable connections and collaborations. Without a network of supporters vouching for you, it's harder to gain trust and credibility.

_Building in isolation limits your exposure to new ideas and vital feedback._

## **Hidden cost #3: Unrealized potential**

Staying motivated and focused is challenging when you're on your own. Without support, revenue opportunities slip through your fingers, and making strategic decisions can be daunting.

_Unrealized potential is the most disappointing hidden cost._

**But here's the good news:** these _hidden costs are 100% avoidable_.

# **How do you avoid the hidden costs?**

Join a community (or build your own).

There are five features you’re looking for when finding a community (or creating it):

1. The community **engages in regular events**, activities, and conversations.
2. The community **inspires a sense of belonging** with a dedicated space for members to hang out.
3. The community **offers a unique identity** its members are proud to represent.
4. The community **shares simple rituals** to strengthen connections.
5. The community is **built on** **a foundation of togetherness**, with a strong, clear mission.

With a community gathered around you and your business, you unlock a wealth of knowledge, inspiration, and support.

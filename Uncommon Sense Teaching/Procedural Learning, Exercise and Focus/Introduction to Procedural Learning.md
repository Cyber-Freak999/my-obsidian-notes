# Two Pathways of Learning: Declarative and Procedural
The human brain has two distinct learning pathways: **declarative** and **procedural**. Each plays a critical role in how we acquire knowledge and skills. 

- **Declarative learning** is the conscious process of learning and recalling facts, concepts, and information. It involves the hippocampus and is typically what we use when memorizing or learning something intentionally, like directions or academic knowledge. This pathway enables working memory to store and retrieve information that can be consciously articulated or explained.
  
- **Procedural learning**, in contrast, is subconscious and relies on the **basal ganglia**. This pathway is activated through repetition and practice, helping to embed habits and complex skills into long-term memory without conscious thought. Tasks like typing on a keyboard or driving a familiar route are learned and performed through this procedural system.

# Procedural Learning and Its Role in Habit Formation
While declarative learning allows for the conscious understanding of new information, **procedural learning** is essential for mastering skills that become automatic. For example, you might rely on declarative learning when navigating a new route, but after repeated practice, your brain stores this information procedurally, enabling you to drive that route without thinking about every turn.

This system is also involved in learning habits and automatic behaviors, such as typing without looking at the keyboard or starting sentences with capital letters. Once information is learned procedurally, it no longer requires conscious effort, freeing the brain to focus on other tasks.

# The Power of the Procedural System in Complex Patterns
Beyond forming habits, the procedural system plays a significant role in understanding **complex patterns**. This is particularly evident in areas like language acquisition and mathematics. 

- **Language learning** in toddlers relies heavily on the procedural system, enabling them to recognize and replicate the intricate patterns of their native language without conscious effort.
  
- In mathematics, procedural learning helps individuals recognize patterns and solve problems intuitively. This ability to "feel" complex mathematical concepts highlights the depth of procedural learning.

Interestingly, artificial intelligence has also leveraged procedural learning to master games like chess and Go, surpassing human expertise by recognizing patterns through repetition and reinforcement.

# Integrating Declarative and Procedural Learning for Enhanced Education
For optimal learning, itâ€™s crucial to engage both **declarative** and **procedural** systems. While declarative learning helps with understanding concepts consciously, procedural learning embeds these concepts more deeply through practice. 

Teaching approaches that target both pathways allow students to learn the same material in different ways, creating a richer and more comprehensive understanding. For example, after students are introduced to new concepts declaratively, providing ample practice opportunities engages their procedural system, making the knowledge more intuitive and ingrained.

Incorporating both systems in education can help students retain information better and apply it more effortlessly in real-world scenarios.

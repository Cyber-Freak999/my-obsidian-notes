# Why are APIs targeted?
APIs are really this sort of central choke point the flow of data between the interfaces and the backend. What we find is that when we look under the hood at these APIs inside organizations, not only do they provide direct access to this sensitive information and data, but these APIs are often over permissioned.
We find that they have excessive rights granted to those APIs. And these are the types of things that can create these logic flaws.
The other reason why APIs are such an interesting target for attack is they make life a whole lot easier for the attackers compared to the classic attack route.

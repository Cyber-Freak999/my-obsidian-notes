# Differentiation
**Differentiation** in teaching allows educators to adjust their approach to meet the diverse needs of students with varying levels of background knowledge and working memory capacity. A small gesture, such as addressing individual student interests, can make learning more engaging and personalized. Differentiation doesn't have to be complicated—working with a few students or providing alternative ways to grasp concepts can make a significant difference.

# Scaffolding
**Scaffolding** is a crucial support system that helps students gradually overcome challenging material. This support can include breaking down tasks into smaller steps, offering additional practice time, and using questions at different difficulty levels. For students with lesser working memory (hikers), scaffolding can make learning easier and more effective.

**Scaffolding for high-capacity learners** (race car learners) involves providing more challenging, in-depth questions, opportunities to work on complex tasks, or allowing them to create their own problems. Avoid giving them repetitive tasks, and instead, offer meaningful "sponge activities" like reading or solving advanced problems to keep them engaged.

Balancing both types of learners is key. Teachers need to create opportunities that help all students, regardless of their working memory capacity, reach their potential. For hikers, this may involve more practice and repetition, while for race car learners, more challenging and creative tasks may be required. A teacher’s role involves creating opportunities for **all students to reach their potential**, regardless of their initial learning speed or working memory capacity.

Long-term memory plays an important role. Students with lesser working memory can enhance their learning by forming strong, varied neural links in long-term memory through extra practice and retrieval, allowing them to compensate for their working memory limitations.

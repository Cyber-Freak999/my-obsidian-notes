- Learning involves forming connections between neurons in the brain.
- The "learn it" stage involves the introduction of new information or skills, where connections begin forming under guidance.
- The "link it" stage strengthens these neural connections as students retrieve and practice learned material independently.
- Long-term memories are stored in the neocortex, a thin layer on the surface of the brain.
- Although the brain has a vast storage capacity, the challenge lies in effectively storing and retrieving information.
- Techniques such as rereading, highlighting, retrieval practice, and creating concept maps are explored for efficiency in memory retention.
- Retrieval practice, or active recall, is highlighted as a powerful learning technique.

# Hebbian Learning
Hebbian learning is a fundamental theory in neuroscience that explains how neurons in the brain strengthen their connections based on activity patterns. The principle is often summarized as: *"Cells that fire together, wire together."* It is named after Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb, who proposed this concept in 1949.

## Key Points of Hebbian Learning
1. **Synaptic Strengthening**: When two neurons are activated simultaneously or in close succession, the synapse (connection) between them becomes stronger. Over time, this repeated activation reinforces the connection, making it easier for one neuron to activate the other.

2. **Co-activation of Neurons**: Hebbian learning is based on the idea that if a presynaptic neuron (sending signal) and a postsynaptic neuron (receiving signal) are repeatedly activated together, their connection will strengthen. This makes future communication between the two neurons more efficient.

3. **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)**: Hebbian learning is closely linked to the concept of LTP, a biological process where the synaptic strength between neurons is increased. LTP is believed to be a neural mechanism underlying learning and memory.

4. **Association and Pattern Recognition**: Hebbian learning allows the brain to recognize patterns and associate related stimuli. For example, if a person frequently sees an image of a cat while hearing the word "cat," the neurons responsible for visual processing and language processing become linked, leading to better recognition and association between the two.

## Applications of Hebbian Learning
- **Neural Networks**: In artificial neural networks, Hebbian learning serves as an inspiration for unsupervised learning algorithms, where the system strengthens the connections between neurons that are activated together.
- **Learning and Memory**: Hebbian learning is believed to play a significant role in how the brain forms memories and learns from experience by creating associations between neurons and strengthening those related to frequently occurring stimuli.

In essence, Hebbian learning explains how repeated experiences reinforce neural connections, shaping learning and memory processes in the brain.

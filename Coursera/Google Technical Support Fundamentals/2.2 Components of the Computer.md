# Data Storage Measurements

In this reading, you will learn about the different names for measurements of data storage capacities and file sizes. Data storage capacity increases in step with the evolution of computer hardware technology. Larger storage capacities allow for dynamic growth in file sizes. These advances make it possible for companies like Netflix and Hulu to store thousands of feature-length films in high video quality formats.

There are standardized sets of terms used to name the ever expanding sizes of data storage and files. For example, the common terms used to describe file sizes and hard drive storage capacity include: bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes. However, if you are a computer engineer, you might use a different set of terms.

## Data storage measurement nomenclature

- **Decimal nomenclature:** kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte, exabyte, zettabyte, yottabyte

The decimal naming system for computer storage uses the metric system of prefixes from the International System of Units: kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta, exa, zetta, and yotta. These prefixes may also be referred to as the decimal system of prefixes. The metric/decimal nomenclature represent a base-10 approximation of the actual amount of data storage bytes. The metric system prefixes were selected to simplify the marketing of computer products.

- **Binary nomenclature:** kibibyte, mebibyte, gibibyte, tebibyte, pebibyte, exbibyte, zebibyte, yobibyte

The binary naming system is a standard set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in partnership with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The ISO 80000 and IEC 80000 guides to units of measurement define the International System of Quantities (ISQ). The prefixes kibi-, mebi-, gibi, -tebi-. pebi-, exbi-, zebi-, and yobi- were created by the IEC organization. They are a blend of the first two letters of the metric prefix fused with the first two letters of the word “binary” (example: **me**gabyte + **bi**nary + **byte**= mebibyte).

Binary measurements of computer data are more accurate than decimal system measurements. While decimal nomenclature is commonly used to market computers and computer parts to the general public, binary nomenclature is often used in computer engineering for numerical accuracy.

## Quantities of storage measurements

As data storage grows, the need for new terminology to describe the exponentially larger byte quantities grows too. The current byte nomenclature, mathematical representations, and storage capacities are as follows:

- **One bit:** Also called a binary digit, bits store an electric signal as 1. The absence of an electric signal is stored as 0, which is also the default value of a bit. One bit can store only one value, either 1 or 0. These two possible values are the basis of the binary number system (base-2) that computers use. All numbers in a base-2 system increase exponentially as powers of 2.
    
- **One byte:** One byte stores eight bits of ones and zeros that translate to a symbol or basic computer instruction. Examples: 01101101 is the byte that translates to the letter “m.” The byte 01111111 tells the computer to delete the character to the right of the cursor.

    # Power Supplies
    
    In this reading, you will learn how to select the correct power supply for a personal computer (PC) to support the main components of the PC.
    
    As you learned in a previous video, computer systems require a direct current (DC) of electricity to operate. However, power companies deliver electricity in alternating currents (AC). AC power can damage the internal components of a computer. To solve this problem, computer power supplies are used to convert the AC from the wall socket to DC. Power supplies also reduce the voltage delivered to the computer’s internal components.
    
    ## Computer architecture
    
    Computer architecture refers to the engineering design of computers and the interconnecting hardware components that together create computing devices that meet functional, performance and cost goals. Power supplies are part of the hardware layer of a computer’s architecture. You learned earlier about the other major hardware components of a computer’s architecture, including the motherboard, chipsets, CPUs, RAM, storage, peripherals, expansion slots and cards, etc. These components influence the size and type of power supply a computer needs.
    
    ## Selecting a power supply
    
    ### Local input voltage
    
    A main consideration when selecting a computer power supply is the voltage delivered to common wall sockets in your country. Power standards for input voltages can vary from country to country. The most common voltage inputs are 110-120 VAC and 220-240 VAC. VAC stands for volts of alternating current.
    
    - **Voltages in the Americas**
    
    North, Central, and parts of South America use the 110-127 VAC standard for common wall sockets. Computers and power supplies sold in these regions are designed to use this level of power.
    
    - **Voltages for most of the world**
    
    Most countries use the 220-240 VAC standard for common wall sockets. Computers and power supplies sold in these areas are designed to use this higher voltage.
    
    Please visit [WorldStandards “Plug, socket & voltage by country”](https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plug-voltage-by-country/) to find your country’s voltage standards.
    
    It is important to use the correct voltage power supply or power converter for the computer’s voltage specifications. Imagine that you have a customer who imported a PC from a country that uses a different standard for input voltage. You will need to adapt the input power to protect the computer. Some options for doing this might include:
    
    - Replace the power supply with a unit that uses the appropriate voltage for the target country.
    - Install a power supply model that includes a dual-voltage switch that can be toggled from 110-120VAC to 220-240VAC.
    - Plug the computer into an external power converter that then plugs into a normal wall socket. Power converters can be purchased from any store that sells international travel merchandise.
    
    Without a power converter, the following problems may be experienced:
    
    |If a computer needs|But the wall socket delivers|The result will be|
    |---|---|---|
    |220-240VAC|110-120VAC|not enough power for the computer to run properly|
    |110-120VAC|220-240VAC|too much power, which will damage the computer’s internal parts|
    
    ### Motherboard engineering specifications
    
    The motherboard and form factor specifications document will provide a list of compatible power supply types to help you select the correct part. The ATX form factor is the most common motherboard design for full-sized, personal desktop computers. You may also find a version of the ITX form factor in smaller computers. The form factor size and components embedded in the motherboards will create a starting point for the minimum power supply wattages required.
    
    ### Power consumption of components
    
    The number of internal components and peripherals the computer will need to support will also determine the minimum wattage a power supply must provide. For example, a basic computer that is designed for word processing and surfing the Internet should work with a standard power supply. However, some computers may need higher wattage power supplies to support items like a powerful CPU, multiple CPUs, multiple hard drives, video rendering applications, a top-tier graphics processing unit (GPU) for gaming, and more.
    
    ## Voltages and pin connectors
    
    The internal hardware components of a computer require varied input voltages to operate. Voltage regulators embedded in the motherboard of the computer control the amount of power that is delivered to the computer’s various internal components.
    
    |Voltage|Examples of components that use each voltage level|
    |---|---|
    |3.3V|DIMMs, chipsets, and some PCI/AGP cards|
    |5V|SIMMS, disk drive logic, ISA, and some voltage regulators|
    |12V|Motors and voltage regulators with high outputs|
    
    The computer’s power supply plugs into an adapter on the computer’s motherboard. The wiring for this connection uses color coded wires. Each wire color carries a different voltage of electricity to the motherboard or serves as a grounding wire. A standard ATX motherboard power adaptor has either 20-pins or 24-pins to connect these wires. The 20-pin design is an older technology. The 24-pin connector was developed to provide more power to support additional expansion cards, powerful CPUs, and more. The 24-pin connector has become the standard for today’s personal computer power supplies and motherboards.
    
    The power supply will have multiple connectors that plug into the motherboard, hard drives, and graphic cards. Each cable has a specific purpose and delivers the appropriate amount of electricity to the following parts:
    
    Connections from a PC power supply (ATX 2)
    
    1. Floppy disk drive (obsolete)
    2. "Molex" universal (e.g. IDE hard drives, optical drives)
    3. SATA drives
    4. Graphics cards 8-pin, separable for 6-pin
    5. Graphics cards 6-pin
    6. Motherboard 8-pin
    7. Motherboard P4 connector, can be combined to 8-pin mainboard connector 12V
    8. ATX2 24-pin, divisible 20+4, and can therefore also be used for old 20-pin connections
    
    You will learn how to install a power supply and connect these power cables later in this module.
    
    ## Key takeaways
    
    When selecting a power supply for a computer, the following items should be taken into consideration:
    
    1. Wall socket input voltage standard for the country where the computer will be used;
    2. The number and power consumption needs of the computer’s internal components;
    3. The motherboard model and form factor engineering specifications and requirements.

    # Connector Types
    
    A computer has many physical ports or connectors. You can use these connectors to connect devices that add functionality to your computing, such as a keyboard, mouse, or monitor. These external devices are called peripherals. IT often works with and troubleshoots these peripherals, so it is helpful to understand the types of connectors. This reading will cover different types of connectors and their uses.
    
    # USB Connectors
    
    ## USB 2.0, 3.0 & 3.1
    
    USB connectors transfer data and power to devices connected to a computer. USB connectors are the most popular connectors for all types of peripherals.
    
    ![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/WAYbQ6VuQTGBPLDQuyLuxA_d40fdf5f35e341218e34ce656391f6f1_IT-Support-Cert-Connector-Types-2-.png?expiry=1693526400000&hmac=w8-AmYH75KcU5-Cp0CScURBHFi-FPexcoqNODu_p9bg](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/WAYbQ6VuQTGBPLDQuyLuxA_d40fdf5f35e341218e34ce656391f6f1_IT-Support-Cert-Connector-Types-2-.png?expiry=1693526400000&hmac=w8-AmYH75KcU5-Cp0CScURBHFi-FPexcoqNODu_p9bg)
    
    There are three generations of USB type A connectors in use today: USB 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1. Here are the differences between the three generations:
    
    - USB 2.0: Black port on the computer, 480 Mbps transfer speed
    - USB 3.0: Blue port on computer, 5 Gbps transfer speed
    - USB 3.1: Teal port on the computer, 10 Gbps transfer speed
    
    USB ports are backwards compatible, meaning a USB port can connect any of the three generations of USB type A connectors. The connected cable will determine the speed of data transfer. Connecting a USB 3 to a USB 2 port will result in 480 megabits (Mbps) per second of speed.
    
    ## Micro USB, USB-C & Lightning Port
    
    Micro USB, USB-C, USB4 (Thunderbolt), and Lightning Ports are smaller connectors that carry more power than older USB connectors and have faster data transfer speeds. These connectors are used for devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets.
    
    ![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/KcuB_jr2QySLgf469kMkKw_e81e401239bd40909e7a82815b29e1f1_Google__Connectors-Image-2---Micro-USB-.png?expiry=1693526400000&hmac=LkKwinpn4CAOqwSZhB4aA9Mh7MaMIOypnMA4PHxV5Hs](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/KcuB_jr2QySLgf469kMkKw_e81e401239bd40909e7a82815b29e1f1_Google__Connectors-Image-2---Micro-USB-.png?expiry=1693526400000&hmac=LkKwinpn4CAOqwSZhB4aA9Mh7MaMIOypnMA4PHxV5Hs)
    
    - **Micro USB** is a small USB port found on many non-Apple cellphones, tablets, and other portable devices.
    - **USB-C** is the newest reversible connector with either end having the same build. USB-C cables replace traditional USB connectors since they can carry significantly more power and transfer data at 20 Gbps.
    - **USB4** uses Thunderbolt 3 protocol and USB-C cables to transfer data at speeds of 40 Gbps and provide power as well.
    - **Lightning Port** is a connector exclusive to Apple that is similar to USB-C. It is used for charging and connecting devices to computers, external monitors, cameras and other peripherals.

    ## Projectors
    
    Projectors are display devices for when you need to share information with people in the same location! Most projectors can be used just like any other display on a computer, and with a few differences, can be troubleshot just like any other display device. For example, projectors can have **dead** or **stuck** **pixels**, and can acquire **image burn-in**, just like other types of displays.
    
    ## Connectors and Cables
    
    You will connect a computer to a projector using a display cable like [VGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector), [DVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface#Connector), [HDMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#Connectors), or [DisplayPort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Full-size_DisplayPort_connector). When you do this, the computer's operating system will detect that a new display has been added. Depending on what your computer's video adapter supports, this new display can be **extended** or **mirrored** just like if you had added a second monitor!

    A lot of times, display issues with projectors come down to the connectors and the cables that you are using. Because people frequently connect and disconnect from projectors, the cables and connectors can become worn out or damaged. Always consider this early in your troubleshooting if the projection display flickers or disappears.
    
    ## Device Drivers
    
    Just like other display devices, if your computer does not correctly recognize the display resolution of the projector it may default to a very low-resolution **VGA mode** like 640x480 or 1024x768. If this happens, your computer may need a device driver for your projector. Take a look at the support website for your projector's manufacturer!
    
    ## Lighting
    
    Projectors often rely on expensive, hot, very bright **incandescent** bulbs, or **lamps**. If a projector gets too hot for the lamp to safely operate, the projector will shut down. If the lamp burns out, the projector will either not work or will shut itself down. It is increasingly common for projectors to rely on LED lights, rather than incandescent lamps. These LED lights have far fewer issues with overheating, and have much longer lifespans than incandescent lamps.
    
    ## Calibration
    
    Sometimes, like when a projector is first installed, reset, or moved, you will need to **calibrate** the projector image to account for the distance and angle that the projector is installed at. If the image is skewed or [keystoned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_effect), you might need to recalibrate the projector geometry. Calibrating the image involves focusing the image, and making adjustments to the image to make it square and aligned with the projection surface. Every projector is a little different, so refer to the vendor documentation to complete this task!

Securing Cookies is an important part of Application security. Cookies are a common target for attackers, as they often contain sensitive information. It is important to take a few steps to help protect your cookies from malicious actors.

One way to help protect cookies is to encrypt them. By encrypting the data, attackers will not be able to access the contents of the cookie. Additionally, using secure flags and HTTP-only flags can help ensure that the cookies are not sent over unencrypted connections.

It is also important to ensure that the cookies are set to expire after a certain period of time. This prevents them from being used indefinitely by an attacker.

Another attack that can be used to gain access to cookies is Cross-site Scripting (XSS). XSS attacks allow attackers to inject malicious code into web pages and potentially gain access to users' cookies. To prevent this attack, it is important to validate user input, properly encode user output, and use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict what scripts can run on a webpage.

Finally, a real-world example of an attack involving cookies happened in 2018. An attacker was able to gain access to hundreds of millions of users' data by exploiting a vulnerability in a cookie set by a third-party provider. This shows the importance of properly securing cookies, as well as the real-world implications of a lack of security.

### **Mitigation**

* Encrypt cookies to prevent attackers from accessing their contents
* Use secure and HTTP-only flags to help ensure that the cookies are not sent over unencrypted connections
* Set cookies to expire after a certain period of time, to prevent them from being used indefinitely by an attacker
* Validate user input, properly encode user output, and use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict what scripts can run on a webpage to prevent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks
* Finally, be aware of the real-world implications of a lack of security - as demonstrated in 2018 when an attacker was able to gain access to hundreds of millions of users' data by exploiting a vulnerability in a cookie set by a third-party provider.

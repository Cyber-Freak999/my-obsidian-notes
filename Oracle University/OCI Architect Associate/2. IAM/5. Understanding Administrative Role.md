# TL;DR

- OCI IAM provides **predefined administrator roles** to delegate domain-level tasks without needing to write policies.
    
- These roles apply **only within the identity domain**, not at the tenancy or compartment level.
    
- Roles include:
    
    - **Identity Domain Administrator** (Superuser)
        
    - **Security Administrator**
        
    - **Application Administrator**
        
    - **User Administrator**
        
    - **User Manager**
        
    - **Help-Desk Administrator**
        
    - **Audit Administrator**
        
- Roles simplify **delegation**, **access management**, and align with **Cloud security best practices**.

# Why Are Administrator Roles Important?

- They allow **granular delegation** of responsibilities.
    
- Reduce dependency on a single **domain admin** (superuser).
    
- No need to write complex IAM **policy statements**.
    
- Promote **least privilege** access model for better security.

# **Predefined Administrator Roles in OCI IAM**

|**Role**|**Purpose & Permissions**|
|---|---|
|**Identity Domain Administrator**|Full access across the domain. Can manage users, groups, apps, security, auditing, notifications, and delegate admin roles to others.|
|**Security Administrator**|Manages MFA, password policies, sign-in policies, security settings, and identity providers.|
|**Application Administrator**|Manages application integrations. Can add apps, assign access to users/groups, and manage app configuration.|
|**User Administrator**|Full user and group management. Can create/delete users and groups, and manage memberships.|
|**User Manager**|Limited version of user admin. Can manage users (e.g., reset passwords, update info, activate/deactivate), optionally scoped to specific groups.|
|**Help-Desk Administrator**|Basic user support. Can unlock accounts, reset passwords, manage authentication factors, and issue bypass codes.|
|**Audit Administrator**|Can generate and view audit reports, helping track IAM activities for compliance or investigations.|

# Key Characteristics of Administrator Roles

- **Scoped to Identity Domain:**  
    These roles **only apply within a domain**, not at the **tenancy level** or for **OCI compartments**.
    
- **No Custom Policy Writing Required:**  
    Predefined permissions mean domain admins can assign roles **without touching IAM policy syntax**.
    
- **Security-Aligned:**  
    Each role supports **least-privilege** principles — users only get permissions needed for their specific responsibilities.
    
- **Easier Management:**  
    Roles abstract the complexity of OCI IAM policies and provide a **user-friendly way** to manage delegated tasks.
# Example Use Cases

- Assign a **Security Admin** to manage password policies without giving access to user data.
    
- Designate an **App Admin** for your Oracle SaaS integrations.
    
- Have **Help-Desk Admins** handle day-to-day user support (like unlocking accounts).
    
- Limit **User Managers** to handling users only in specific groups (e.g., Engineering).
    

# Best Practices

1. **Assign roles only to trusted users.**
    
2. **Avoid adding many users to Domain Admin role** — it grants full control.
    
3. **Use User Manager for department-level delegation.**
    
4. Regularly **audit assigned roles** to ensure no excessive permissions.
    
5. Combine with **MFA** and **strong password policies** to harden admin accounts.

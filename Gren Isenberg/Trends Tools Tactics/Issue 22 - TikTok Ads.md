You’ve got 10 ideas in your notes.  
You’ve bookmarked a dozen Cursor tutorials.  
You’ve replayed a SIP clip with Greg saying “build what people want” twenty times.

But now you’re stuck asking the killer question: _Which idea should I build?_

The answer won’t come from more frameworks. You need signal - some actual data points that show, “this idea has legs.” That doesn’t mean a landing page, a waitlist, or a feedback form.

You can find your signal with a short-form video ad. You don’t need to go viral, drive traffic, or sell anything.

For $50, you can validate interest with clicks and comments.
# Trends: TikTok Ads for Idea Validation
The old validation playbook is dying.
Sketch an MVP. Code for weeks. Launch a landing page. Drive traffic. Wait for feedback. Hope it works.
Sounds more like gambling than validating to me.
The new playbook: Test before you build — with data, not guesses.
And TikTok Ads are one of the best ways to test ideas in 2025 for three reasons:
1. **Speed**​  
    While typical ad tests take weeks to gather data, TikTok shows you clear signals in 72 hours.
2. **Precision**​  
    TikTok's targeting lets you test different audiences with surgical accuracy. The platform's 1.5B+ users mean you can find any niche, demographic, or interest group.
3. **Simplicity**​  
    You don't need a product, a funnel, or even a website. Just a 15-second video with a problem and solution.
It’s real strangers reacting in real time.
Instead of hoping, future founders are spending a few hundred dollars to know exactly what people want.
With today’s tools, running your first test video ad is easier than ever.
No ads experience needed.

# Tactics
1. **Steal what’s already working**
	**What:** Search TikTok Ads to find hooks, angles, and formats that are performing.
	**Why:** You don't have to start from scratch when you can learn from others. Let the market show you what people resonate with.
	**How:**
	1. Go to [Fastmoss' TikTok Ad Search](https://www.fastmoss.com/marketing/search) and plug in keywords related to your idea.
	2. Filter for ads with high engagement rates (look for 3%+ engagement).
	3. Save 2–3 examples you could borrow structure from - same rhythm, different product.
	**Tip:** Pay special attention to the first 3 seconds. Note the problem it speaks to, how it’s framed, and what the comments say. That’s where the signal lives.

2. **Create your 15-second validation test**_
	**What**: Make a simple video that names a specific problem and shows your solution.
	**Why:** This is the quickest way to know if your idea has legs. You’re optimizing for signal, not style. You don’t need a logo, landing page, or branding.
	**How:**
	1. Pick one angle from your Fastmoss search (problem-solution is usually a good start).
	2. Write a simple script: state the problem, show the fix. (keep it under 50 words).
	3. Build your video using Canva, CapCut, or another basic tool. Stock clips will work.
	**Tip:** Don’t overthink production. The best-performing TikTok ads often look like something a friend filmed in their kitchen.

3. **Launch your ad to test signal**
	**What:** Test your video ad on TikTok with a small budget to see if anyone bites.
	**Why:** Real market data without the big risk. If no one clicks, no one cares. $50 spent now could save you months building something nobody wants.
	**How:**
	1. Launch your video in TikTok Ads Manager with a $30–$50 budget.
	2. Choose basic audience targeting (start broad).
	3. Point the CTA to a basic Notion page or calendar booking link.
	4. Watch for early indicators: clicks, comments, saves, view rate.
	**Tip:** Use TikTok’s interest categories + age/gender filters. If you get no traction, good - that’s signal. Try a new angle or audience.

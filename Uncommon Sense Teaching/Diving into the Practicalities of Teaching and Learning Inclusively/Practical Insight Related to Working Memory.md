# Music and Working Memory
The effect of music on studying depends on a student's working memory capacity.
Race car learners (high-capacity) can often study with music without negative effects. Hikers (low-capacity) may struggle with music while learning difficult tasks but can manage with simpler tasks or routines.
Math generally requires more working memory. It's advised to avoid music while studying math, even for race car learners, though **exceptions exist**.
# Note-taking and Working Memory
Students with high-capacity working memory can manage taking notes while absorbing complex explanations. **Hikers**, with lower working memory capacity, may struggle to take notes while understanding the content and may require more study time outside class to comprehend material.
## Supporting Hiker Learners in Note-taking
- Provide partially filled-out handouts for students to complete together.
- Structure the lessons by outlining the number of key points.
- Take mini-breaks to allow students to reread their notes and ask questions. 
- Use "retrieve-taking" by pausing for students to jot down key points rather than note-taking while teaching.
- Engage students in small group discussions to reinforce understanding.
# Student-directed vs. Teacher-directed Learning
- **Race car learners** often thrive in student-directed learning environments, especially in subjects like math.
  - **Hiker learners**, however, benefit more from a mixed approach of teacher-directed and student-directed learning, especially in challenging subjects.
# **Strategies to Help Hiker Learners:**
   - Keep directions brief and simple, as hikers may struggle with lengthy instructions.
   - Ensure attention before giving directions, using methods like countdowns or group refrains (e.g., "1, 2, 3, eyes on me").
   - Use mnemonics to help students remember larger chunks of information.
   - Provide spelling for difficult words and create checklists for steps to complete tasks.

Providing opportunities for varied practice helps build information in long-term memory, making thinking quicker and more automatic. Once hikers grasp basic concepts, they can work more independently using student-directed approaches.

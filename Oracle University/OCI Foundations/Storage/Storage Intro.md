# üîπ **TL;DR**

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers multiple storage services to match different application needs based on **performance**, **durability**, **persistence**, **connectivity**, and **access protocols**. These include:

- **Local NVMe** for high-performance temporary storage
- **Block Volume** for persistent block-level storage
- **File Storage** for shared file systems
- **Object Storage** for unstructured data accessible via HTTP
- **Data Transfer Services** for migrating large data sets into OCI

# **Before You Choose Storage, Consider:**

|Requirement|Description|
|---|---|
|**Persistence**|Is the storage temporary (e.g., for caching) or permanent (e.g., for databases)?|
|**Durability**|Do you need redundant copies? (e.g., for backup or disaster recovery)|
|**Data Type**|Structured (e.g., DB) or unstructured (e.g., video, images, logs)?|
|**Performance**|How many **IOPS** (Input/Output operations per second) or **throughput** do you need?|
|**Connectivity**|Do you want local (attached) or remote (networked) storage?|
|**Access Protocol**|Will it be accessed as block, file, or via HTTP APIs?|

# **Key OCI Storage Services**

## **Local NVMe**

- **What it is**: High-speed SSD storage **physically attached** to the compute instance.
- **Use case**: Temporary, ultra-fast storage for performance-heavy apps (e.g., databases, analytics).
- **Persistence**: ‚ùå Not persistent ‚Äì data is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated.
- **Performance**: ‚úÖ Very high ‚Äì ideal for apps needing low-latency and high IOPS.

## **Block Volume**

- **What it is**: Remote, persistent block storage accessed over a network.
- **Use case**: OS disks, databases, applications that require a filesystem.
- **Persistence**: ‚úÖ Persistent ‚Äì survives even if the instance is terminated.
- **Durability**: ‚úÖ Backed by multiple copies and optional backups.
- **Access Protocol**: Block-level, mount as a disk.
## **[[File Storage]]**

- **What it is**: Managed **shared file system** in the cloud (NFS).
- **Use case**: Apps that require a shared filesystem ‚Äì e.g., web servers, analytics pipelines.
- **Persistence**: ‚úÖ Persistent
- **Access Protocol**: File-level, mount via NFS
- **Shared Access**: ‚úÖ Multiple instances can read/write to the same volume.
## **[[Object Storage]]**

- **What it is**: Scalable, **web-accessible** storage for unstructured data (files, images, backups).    
- **Use case**: Archive, backup, big data, media files.    
- **Access Protocol**: HTTP(S) using `PUT`, `GET`, etc.    
- **Durability**: ‚úÖ 11 nines (99.999999999%) ‚Äì highly durable.    
- **Persistence**: ‚úÖ Long-term data retention.    

# **Data Transfer Services**

For migrating **large-scale** datasets to OCI:

|Service|Description|
|---|---|
|**Data Transfer Disk**|Ship your own disks to Oracle for upload|
|**Data Transfer Appliance**|Use Oracle‚Äôs appliance (like AWS Snowball) to send high-volume data securely|

| Need                        | Best Option                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| High IOPS / temporary       | **Local NVMe**                     |
| Persistent disk for VM / DB | **Block Volume**                   |
| Shared filesystem           | **File Storage**                   |
| Archive or media files      | **Object Storage**                 |
| Physical data migration     | **Data Transfer Disk / Appliance** |

- Enforce API governance and establish central API controls
	- Gateway, marketplace platform
	- No API goes live without passing gates(docs, testing, security)
- Create comprehensive testing program
	- Testing every endpoints across all OWASP attack types and more
	- Evaluate every data object, user type and function for logic flaws
	- Leverage automation for comprehensive test coverage
- Implement automated, continuous testing
	- Although APIs rarely change, code and infrastructure does
	- Every release needs functional and security testing
	- Integrate testing into CI/CD pipelines
- Develop API security metrics and assess progress
	-  Total APIs managed - new, existing, retired
	- Vulnerabilities identified, outstanding, fixed

# API Do's and Don't
- Don't trust anything(inputs/networks)
- Do validate all inputs
- Don's confuse obfuscation with security - keep sensitive stuff out of code
- Don't hardcode keys/tokens
- Don't reveal useful info in error messages
- Don't have hidden/ unadvertised features
- Don't filter data in UI - control at app level
- Don't confuse authentication with authorisation
- Do use Gateways to control access, traffic
- Do require API documentation
- Do expect users/hackers to find and use undocumented endpoints
- Do continuously test - simulate attacks, test configs, fuzzing, etc

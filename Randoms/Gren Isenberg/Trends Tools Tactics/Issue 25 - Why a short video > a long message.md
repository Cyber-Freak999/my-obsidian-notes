90% of builders hide behind walls of text.

Clever tweets, long posts, fluffy emails.

Thousands of words skimmed, ignored, or deleted without a care.

Most know by now video converts better, but few ever hit record. No one likes seeing themselves on video.

That means an arbitrage opportunity.

Your face and your voice build trust faster than words on a screen can. Videos make communication more personal, more engaging.

They get more attention and more responses.

That's why videos work so well for things like outreach, pitches, and on-boarding.

Some are using crunchy, low-pro videos to sell their services and products 90% on autopilot.

Let's see what it means for internet entrepreneurs.

# Trends

Attention spans are shrinking.

We skim texts, skip ads, and scroll to the next thing.

Sub-90-second videos are the only things left that anyone has time for.

We’ll still watch a short video. In fact, we love a short video.

- 65% will watch a cold-video to the end if it’s under a minute
- Video messages get [26% more replies](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0unz7zqwrt0howvexwumhz8vv544fl/dpheh0heo92x5zfm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFpbG1vZG8uY29tL2d1aWRlcy92aWRlby1lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmctc3RhdGlzdGljcy8=) than text-only outreach
- ​[Close rates jump 41%](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0unz7zqwrt0howvexwumhz8vv544fl/e0hph7h7l3dz4ps8/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmlkeWFyZC5jb20vYmxvZy9zYWxlcy1hbmQtbWFya2V0aW5nLXN0YXRzLw==) when proposals include videos

One video can build more rapport than weeks of back-and-forth emails. The more others resist video, the more yours stand out.

Videos can be your edge for every touch point:

- For cold outreach
- For pitching async offers
- For onboarding new clients
- For delighting new customers

Your words don’t need polish. They just need a face - you, talking to one person, with one clear point, in give or take one minute.

Today’s tools reduce the friction for starting to basically zero.

# Tactics
1) _**Pitch with an evergreen video**_
	
	**What:** Use a short, reusable video intro to warm up cold DMs.
	
	**Why:** When someone sees your face and hears your voice, you're not just a name in their inbox - you’re a real person. And real people get replies.
	
	**How:**
	
	1. **Write your pitch like a voice note.** Talk like you're sending a friend a quick update. Keep it under 1min.
	2. **Record one pitch video.** Speak to the type of person you help, not the specific lead. Think: who you help, what you do, and why it’s relevant.
	3. **Send it with a personalized intro.  
	    ​**_”Hey [name], saw what you’re doing with [X] - figured I’d intro with a 44 second video (no one wants a wall of text) - Loom link”_
	
	**Tip**: Use [Loom’s AI audio variables feature](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0unz7zqwrt0howvexwumhz8vv544fl/p8heh9h42wpexlhq/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdXBwb3J0Lmxvb20uY29tL2hjL2VuLXVzL2FydGljbGVzLzE0OTc0NzIzNTQ0NzMzLUhvdy10by1wZXJzb25hbGl6ZS12aWRlb3MtYXQtc2NhbGUjOn46dGV4dD1BdWRpbyUyMHZhcmlhYmxlcyUyMHdvcmslMjBieSUyMGlkZW50aWZ5aW5nLHRoZSUyMHZpZGVvJTIwYXVkaW8lMjBhbmQlMjB0cmFuc2NyaXB0Lg==) to change names in-video.

2) _**Pin a “what I do” video to your profiles**_

	**What:** Explain your business/service in a short video you can share everywhere.
	
	**Why:** Bios are vague. Websites are too long. A video shows who you help, how you help them, and why they should care. It’s a no-pressure pitch.
	
	**How:**
	1. **Use this prompt to guide your approach:  
	    ​**_“I help [who] do [what] so they can [outcome].”_
	2. **Film it like you're answering a DM.** Keep it honest, casual, to the point.
	3. **Link it anywhere someone might vet you.** Your website, socials, email signature, DM replies. Let your video pitch speak before you do.
	
	**Tip:** Start with your full face before sharing your screen. Eye contact builds trust out in the cold.

3) _**Plug videos into your onboarding flow**_
	
	**What:** Include short videos to guide new clients/customers through their first steps.
	
	**Why**: Videos make it feel personal. It shows you care enough to take the extra step. You’re showing when most send nothing or walls of text no one reads.
	
	**How:**
	
	1. **Use this prompt to find your starting point:  
	    ​**_“List 3 questions new clients are likely ask in the first 48 hours.”_
	2. **Record a video that answers one question.** Begin with _“You might be wondering…”_
	3. **Put it at your first touchpoint.** Welcome email, Notion doc, or even a DM.
	4. **Repeat for other key moments.** Add micro videos to follow-ups or delivery check-ins.
	
	**Tip**: Use Supercut to clip one video into 2-3 onboarding moments.

# **<** **TLDR:** **>**

**→ Nobody wants to read a wall of text, but most will watch a 59-second video.**

**→ Tools like Loom & Supercut make recording and sharing videos frictionless.**

**→ Add videos to your outreach, branding, & onboarding to stand out in a sea of text.**

The one obstacle left is psychological.

Get over the cringe, and you'll have a compounding advantage.

Trust builds faster with imperfect production anyway. Use your laptop or your phone.

Start with one bad video.

# Why Organizations Need Security
As the digital era reshapes how organizations operate globally, it brings along significant challenges. While technology enhances collaboration, streamlines operations, and drives innovation, it also introduces risks—data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other cyber threats. These incidents frequently make headlines, underlining the critical need for digital protection.

Organizations face two choices: revert to outdated methods and forgo the benefits of modern tech, or embrace innovation while securing their digital infrastructure. The latter is the only viable path forward. Just as companies invest in securing physical assets, they must equally prioritize protecting digital assets to ensure business continuity and achieve their goals without disruption.

# The Role of a Security Engineer

To address these digital threats, organizations hire security engineers. These professionals are seen as the guardians of an organization’s digital environment. Their responsibilities typically include:
- Taking ownership of the organization’s overall cybersecurity posture.
- Minimizing cyber risks through proactive planning and rapid response strategies.
- Designing and implementing systems to detect, mitigate, and prevent security threats.
- Conducting regular security assessments to uncover vulnerabilities and apply effective mitigations.
- Building and maintaining secure, reliable network architectures and system infrastructures.
- Collaborating across teams to establish and enforce security protocols organization-wide.
## Qualifications for a Security Engineer

The role of a security engineer is broad and often shaped by the specific needs of each organization. In essence, a security engineer approaches complex security issues like an engineer—by breaking them down into manageable parts and solving them methodically. This means the day-to-day work can vary significantly.

Key qualifications organizations typically look for include:
- 0–2 years of experience in IT administration, technical support, networking, or security operations.
- A foundational understanding of operating systems, networking concepts, and basic programming.
- Familiarity with core security principles, particularly in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).
Security engineers are expected to be adaptable, analytical, and proactive in navigating evolving threat landscapes and securing organizational assets.
# Core Responsibilities of a Security Engineer
## Asset Management/Asset Inventory
One of the primary steps in ensuring an organization's security is to maintain an organization's asset inventory. In terms of cyber security, this will mean managing and maintaining an inventory of an organization's digital assets. Security engineers can only own an organization's security if they know what assets the organization has. They must also ensure that this asset inventory is regularly maintained and updated and includes all the required information about assets such as asset name, type, IP addresses, physical location, place in the network, applications running on an asset, access permissions (only within the organization or public-facing), and the asset owner details.
## Security Policies
An organization needs robust security policies to maintain a sound security posture. A security engineer helps the organization create security policies based on established Security Principles. These policies are then implemented organization-wide, and the security engineer ensures that the implementation follows the letter and spirit of the policies. Sometimes, a need arises for granting exceptions to the security policies due to business needs. In such scenarios, the security engineer consults the security principles to allow or deny exceptions and suggest mitigating steps to minimize risks. 
## Secure by Design  
A security engineer ensures that the organization is secure by design. The engineer understands that the security posture receives the most Return on Investment (ROI) if it follows a secure-by-design philosophy. This means that the security engineer takes steps to implement a Secure Network Architecture, ensures the organization's [Windows](https://tryhackme.com/room/microsoftwindowshardening), [Linux](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxsystemhardening), and [Active Directory](https://tryhackme.com/room/activedirectoryhardening) are hardened, and software development follows the Secure Software Development Lifecycle.
## Security Assessment and Assurance
While securely designing the organization's network and infrastructure might be an excellent first step, a security engineer understands that their job is far from done after that. They understand that security is hard work that requires continuous effort. While a security engineer must ensure everything is done correctly, a compromise requires just one loophole to be successful. To mitigate risks from a continuously evolving threat landscape, a security engineer plans to conduct regular security assessments, audits, and red-teaming and purple-teaming exercises to continuously improve the security posture. While security engineers might not be performing assessments and audits themselves, they are primarily involved in helping schedule these activities, creating Request for Quotations (RFQs) for external parties to perform these activities, and helping prioritize and implement the findings from them.
# Continuous Improvement
## Ensuring Awareness
A security engineer might be tasked with maintaining a certain security awareness level in the organization. Humans are the building blocks of any organization, and as is often said, humans are the weakest link in an organization's security. A security engineer periodically runs awareness sessions targeting primarily social engineering attacks to ensure that humans don't make mistakes that can compromise an organization's security. Awareness sessions are also organized for specific teams to ensure they follow security principles related to their area of expertise, like secure software development or secure network architecture.
## Managing Risks
The executive management of most organizations looks at security from the lens of minimizing risks. Security is essential to businesses because ignoring it can result in operational disruptions, data leakage, lawsuits, or other forms of risk. Therefore, a security engineer is often tasked with identifying security risks, determining their likelihood and impact, and finding solutions to minimize those risks. It must be noted that eliminating all risks might not be possible when running business operations. Sometimes, a decision has to be made to accept a risk and move on. In such a scenario, the security engineer might perform some mitigating actions to lower the risk. Accepting or mitigating risks is often a business decision, and a security engineer acts as a trusted advisor of the management that helps them take this decision by providing subject matter expertise. Let's take the example of an organization that uses a database software for its supply chain that runs on a vulnerable version of Linux. This software is essential to the organization's operations. Updating the software, so that it can run on the latest OS version that is not vulnerable, without impacting operations might take significant effort (more than a year). It will require engagement with the vendor, who has not yet tested the software on the latest OS version. Deploying the software without testing on the latest OS version will risk causing problems in the organization's operations. In such a scenario, the vulnerable OS version poses a security risk. A security engineer might suggest mitigating the risk by hardening the OS through additional controls and adding a reverse proxy in front of the vulnerable system to avoid exposing it to the internet. While these steps will not eliminate the risk, they will significantly reduce it without affecting the organization's operations.
## Change Management
Organizations keep evolving with time, which also results in changes in their security posture. To ensure a robust security posture, the security engineer keeps track of changes in the organization's digital assets that can affect the security posture and takes measures to improve the security posture with the organization's evolution. Let's assume an organization wants to upgrade the e-commerce module of its website for its corporate customers. The new module will require a risk assessment, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment before integrating with the website. The security engineer will ensure that all these requirements are fulfilled and that the integration will not introduce security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it will also be ensured that the new module follows all the security policies and guidelines laid out by the organization.
## Vulnerability Management
The threat landscape is continuously evolving. New software versions are released, and vulnerabilities are found in the older versions. The security engineer's job often includes monitoring vulnerabilities across the organization and planning to patch or minimize their risk. Vulnerabilities are generally patched according to severity, as we will learn in the [Vulnerability Management](https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnerabilitymanagementkj) room.
## Compliance and Audits
A significant part of a security engineer's duties includes ensuring compliance with regulatory and organizational requirements. Depending on the industry, clientele, and location of the organization, it might be subject to various compliance standards such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO27001, NIST-800-53, and more. A security engineer works closely with both internal and external auditors to detect any non-compliance issues and effectively address them. Additionally, they are responsible for upholding the organization's security certifications as needed.
# Additional Roles and Responsibilites
## Managing Security Tooling
A security engineer might sometimes be required to configure or fine-tune security tools such as SIEMs, Firewalls, WAFs, EDRs, and more. In some organizations, that might also be the primary responsibility of a security engineer. In such a role, a security engineer might also be making decisions or providing input to decision-makers about tools to procure based on the organization's requirements and the engineer's assessments of competitive tools.
## Tabletop Exercises
Tabletop exercises are often conducted to gauge the operational readiness of an organization from a security point of view. Certain scenarios are identified to be exercised, and security team members must explain their respective roles in the scenarios under discussion. For example, a scenario might include the compromise of an endpoint device through a phishing email. All the team members will then explain their respective steps per the organization's playbooks. The security engineer is sometimes required to conduct these exercises.
## Disaster Recovery and Crisis Management
A robust security posture requires organizations to plan for untoward incidents, disasters, or crises. In any such scenario, the top priority of the executive management is to maintain business continuity. A security engineer might be involved in disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management planning as part of the different compliance frameworks and the organization's internal policies. The role of a security engineer in these areas might differ depending on the organization.

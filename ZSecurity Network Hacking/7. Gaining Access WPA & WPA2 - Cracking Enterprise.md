Most WPA/WPA2 networks use PSK authentication. Here a shared key is used to authenticate users i.e one key per network.

For WPA Enterprise, each user has their own login credentials for the network. Authentication is managed through a central server(RADIUS Server). Quite Similar to captive portal.

# Problems of this config
- Encryption is used, so can't sniff credentials in monitor mode
- Can't use ARP spoofing because we need to connect first

The solution is to run an evil twin attack 

# Using a Traditional Fake AP
## Advantages
- Passwords is sent in plain text
- No need to decrypt it.
## Drawbacks
- Has to be an open network when users know their network use WPA/WPA2
- They have to enter password in a web page

# Using a Fake Enterprise IP
## Advantages
- Looks and behave like an enterpise network
## Drawbacks
- Captured passwords will be encrypted

# PoC
- Install hostapd-wpe
- edit the config file "/etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf"
- edit the interface and SSID
- stop the network manager to be able to creata a network => "hostapd-wpe /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf"
- Deauth clients for this operation

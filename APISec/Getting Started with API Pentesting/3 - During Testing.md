# üîê **Where to Start API Testing**

- Use **OWASP API Security Top 10** as your guide.
- Begin with **BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization)** ‚Äî it's the most common and impactful flaw.
- Test using both the **2019 and 2023** versions, even if some issues were removed (e.g., **injection**, **insufficient logging**), because they still matter in real-world APIs.

# üîü **10 API Hacking Tips (Slightly Detailed)**

1. **Organize API Endpoints**
    - Use OpenAPI specs + Postman to auto-organize.
    - For reverse-engineered APIs, manually sort endpoints by resource type or function before testing.
2. **Use OWASP ASVS for Depth**
    - ASVS defines 3 levels of testing:
        - Level 1: Basic (low-risk apps)
        - Level 2: Standard (most APIs)
        - Level 3: Advanced (critical systems)
    - Many **ASVS controls apply to APIs**, making it a solid complement to OWASP Top 10.
3. **Check JWT Token Entropy**
    - Use **Burp Suite Sequencer** to analyze randomness.
    - Capture multiple JWTs and let Burp score the entropy.
4. **Use AI Wisely**
    - Tools like **Postman PostBot**, **Hacking APIs GPT**, and **PenTest GPT** help generate tests, automate flows, and analyze issues.
    - Be cautious: **don‚Äôt enter confidential data into public GPTs**.
5. **Run Risky Tests at the End**
    - Delay testing for:
        - Rate limiting
        - Logging/monitoring issues
        - Fuzzing
    - These can **lock test accounts**, wasting days ‚Äî test them **after core flaws are checked**.
6. **Use OpenAPI.Tools if you have OpenAPI Specification**
    - Central hub for tools that generate docs, SDKs, and test cases from OpenAPI specs.
    - Helpful for automation and vulnerability scanning.
7. **Leverage MindAPI**
    - A **mind map on GitHub** created by David Sopes.
    - Covers both **reconnaissance** and **testing**, with linked tools and guides.
8. **Don't Depend Only on Automated Tools**
    - Tools are fast and consistent but lack logic awareness.
    - Human testers catch **business logic flaws, chained attacks**, and **abuse cases**.
9. **Always Confirm Tool Findings**
    - Automation produces **false positives and negatives** due to lack of context.
    - Confirm each finding manually ‚Äî especially for critical or high-risk results.
10. **Adopt the Attacker Mindset**
    - Be creative and curious.
    - Think outside the box
    - Look for small misconfigurations and flaws.
    - Chain minor issues into bigger exploits.
    - Don‚Äôt stop at the first wall ‚Äî find alternative paths.

# Why Responsible AI?

AI is increasingly integrated into daily life and critical decisions (e.g., healthcare, autonomous vehicles). This raises a core question:  
**Can we trust AI systems?**  
Trustworthy AI must be **lawful**, **ethical**, and **robust** to avoid causing harm.
# **Core Principles of Responsible AI**

|Principle|Description|
|---|---|
|**Lawful**|Complies with national and international laws, including domain-specific regulations (e.g., healthcare).|
|**Ethical**|Upholds human dignity, privacy, freedom, equality, and democratic values.|
|**Robust**|Technically and socially reliable, avoids unintended harm or misuse.|
# **Ethical Foundations of AI**

1. **Human Dignity**: Respect mental and physical integrity of individuals.    
2. **Freedom**: Protect privacy and freedom of expression.
3. **Democracy**: Support—not undermine—democratic processes.
4. **Equality**: Prevent unfair bias; ensure fairness in outcomes.
5. **Citizen Rights**: AI must not violate civil rights or liberties.

## **Responsible AI Requirements**

| Requirement                       | Explanation                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Human-Centric**                 | Design AI systems with human oversight and choice.                                         |
| **Technical Robustness**          | Ensure safety, security, and resilience against malicious use; Privacy and data governance |
| **Fairness**                      | Eliminate bias; fairly distribute AI’s benefits and costs; diversity; nondiscrimination    |
| **Transparency & Explainability** | Make AI decisions understandable to those affected.                                        |

## **Responsible AI Implementation Process**

1. **Governance**  
    Establish responsible AI leadership, accountability structures.
2. **Policy Development**  
    Create clear policies and ethical guidelines.    
3. **Monitoring & Evaluation**  
    Continuously assess AI for compliance, fairness, and safety.

The roles Involved in the implementation include:
- **Developers** – build the AI.    
- **Deployers** – integrate AI into systems/processes.
- **End Users** – interact with or are affected by AI.

# **Challenges in AI for Healthcare**

|Challenge|Description|
|---|---|
|**Bias**|AI may reflect biases in training data, underperforming on underrepresented groups.|
|**Lack of Explainability**|Complex AI models (e.g., deep learning) can be "black boxes"—hard to trust without clarity.|
|**Safety**|Ongoing evaluation needed to ensure AI decisions don’t harm patients.|

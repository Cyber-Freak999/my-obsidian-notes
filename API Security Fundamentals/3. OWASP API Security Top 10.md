# API1: Broken Object Level Authorisation(BOLA)
## Description
Most common and damaging API vulnerability. Manipulation of APIs to access data/objects belonging to other users.
Attacker authenticates as User A and then retrieves data on User B
## Risk Exposure
Can lead to data loss, disclosure, data manipulation.
## Prevention
- Define data access policies and implement associated controls
- Enforce data access controls at application logic layer
- Implement automated testing to BOLA flaws.

# API2: Broken Authorisation
## Description
Weak or poor authentication caused by missing or poorly implemented security controls.
Examples:
- Weak password requirements
- Credential stuffing
- No captcha/rate limiting/lockout
- Auth info in URLs(tokens, passwords)
- Non-validation of token expiration
- Insecure password storage
## Risk Exposure
- Account takeover
- Data theft, unauthorised transactions
## Prevention
- Define authentication policies and standards; follow best practices
- Implement continuous testing

# API3: Broken Object Property Level Authorisation
## Description
Exploit of endpoints by reading and/or modifying values of objects ie ability to update object elements(mass assignment).
Revealing unnecessary sensitive data(excessive data exposure)
Examples:
- User is able to change account type ie set "account-type=free" to "account-type=premium"
- User search endpoint returns excessive, unnecessary details
## Risk Exposure
Revealing protected user data
## Prevention
- Ensure user can only access legitimate, permitted fields
- Return only minimum amount of data required for the use case
# API4: Unrestricted Resource Consumption
## Description
Abuse of APIs due to high volumes of API calls, large requests, etc.
Examples:
- Missing/ Inadequate rate controls
- Execution timeouts
- Max allowable memory
- Max number of files, upload size
- Excessive operations in single request
- Excessive records returned in single request
## Risk Exposure
- Denial of Service
- Performance impact
- Mass data harvesting
## Prevention
- Implement traffic controls
- Test effectiveness of controls

# API5: Broken Function Level Authorisation
## Description
Abuse of APIs functionality to improperly modify objects. Often involves replacing passive methods(GET) with active ones(PUT, DELETE).
## Risk Exposure
- Privilege escalation
- Account detail modification
## Prevention
- Identify functions that expose high sensitivity capability and develop controls to limit access
- Implement continuous release testing to ensure proper behaviour

# API6: Unrestricted Acess to Sensitive Business Flows
## Description
Abuse of a legitimate business workflow through excessive, automated use. Rate limiting, captchas are not always effective against fraudulent traffic. Rapid IP rotation makes detection difficult. This is typically a result of application result flaw.
Examples:
- Mass, automated ticket purchasing
- High volume referral bonuses
## Risk Exposure
Loss of critical business activity
## Prevention
- Identify critical business workflows.
- Implement fraudulent traffic detection and controls
- Setup and automate testing of control mechanisms.
# API7: Server Side Request Forgery
## Description
Exploiting URL inputs to make a request to a malicious 3rd party server
The most common examples are Local File Inclusion/Injection(LFI) and user inputting link to malicious sites.
## Risk Exposure
- Malicious requests, data access or other fraudulent activities
- Potential for data leaks
## Prevention
- Validate and sanitise all user-supplied information, including URL parameters.
- Ensure communication only permitted with trusted resources
- Testing URL validation effectiveness
# API8: Security Misconfiguration
## Description
A broad category that encompasses lack of hardening to unnecessary services. These are what bots scan for.
Examples:
- Lack of security hardening
- Improperly configured permission
- Missing security patches
- Unnecessary features enabled
- Missing TLS
- CORS policy missing/improperly set
## Risk Exposure
- Misconfiguration can expose sensitive user data
- Potential for full server compromise
## Prevention
- Implement hardening procedures
- Routinely review configuration
- Implement automated, continuous security testing
# API9: Improper Inventory Management
## Description
Unauthorised API access via old, unused API versions or through trusted 3rd parties.
Examples:
- Old versions of APIs
- Unpatched endpoints
- Endpoints with weaker security
- Outdated documentation
- Unnecessarily exposed endpoints
- API access via 3rd parties
## Risk Exposure
- Data/account theft
- Exposure of sensitive data
## Prevention
- Deploy/ manage all API in Gateway
- Define rules for versioning and retirement
- Periodically audit 3rd party access

# API10: Unsafe Consumption of APIs

## Description
Exposures can occur via use of 3rd party APIs which are generally trusted. However, they can be exploited, which can be used to attack APIs that rely on them
Examples:
- Attacker inserts malicious address data to validation site used by client. Client fails to validate data and get exploited
- Attacker compromises 3rd party API causing it to respond with redirect to malicious site. Client blindly follows redirects without validation.
## Risk Exposure
Data theft, breach, account takeover
## Prevention
- Validate data returned by 3rd party APIs
- Evaluate security controls of 3rd party API
- Encrypt all API communication
- Maintain approved list of known location integrated APIs may be redirected

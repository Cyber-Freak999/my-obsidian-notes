## Reading and Writing Enhance Working Memory
Teaching students to read and write helps to boost their working memory capacity. While literacy increases working memory, it's limited, similar to how environmental factors affect height. Most literate people have a working memory capacity of about four items, but this capacity has a natural limit.

## Desirable Difficulties for Hiker Learners
Students with lower working memory, or "hikers," may struggle more with learning, but their challenges can lead to deeper learning. Psychologist Robert Bjork describes these challenges as "desirable difficulties," meaning that students who learn with more effort often retain the information better and can be just as creative, if not more so, than faster learners.

## Creativity and Long-term Memory
Hikers may have more creativity because their struggle with holding multiple items in working memory allows for more diverse ideas to enter. Their reliance on long-term memory and neural connections compensates for their smaller working memory. When hikers store information in long-term memory, it becomes easier to access and can function similarly to a larger working memory.

## Prior Knowledge Enhances Working Memory
Prior knowledge stored in long-term memory makes working memory more efficient. For example, students who already understand a concept can hold more information in working memory because they can pull from their established neural connections. This is why foundational knowledge is critical, as it expands the effective capacity of working memory on a given subject.

## Practice and Repetition Are Key
For hiker learners, practice and repetition are essential. Just like learning a new skill such as playing the piano or math, consistent practice helps strengthen the neural links in long-term memory, making it easier to recall and apply information in working memory. This practice allows hikers to perform just as well, if not better, than faster learners.

## Importance of Foundational Knowledge
Students need to build foundational knowledge in a subject to retain and utilize new information effectively. The notion that students can "just Google it" is misleadingâ€”without a solid foundation in long-term memory, students can't build a deeper understanding or use their working memory to its full potential.

Docker is a container platform to quickly develop, deploy and manage applications. It packages software into standardised units called containers that include everything necessary for the software to run including libraries, system tools and code.
Automated DevOps tasks include:
- Automate boot processes
- static and dynamic code analysis
- performance testing

# Containers vs VMs
Applications run in completely independent containers.
Containers run in multilevel abstraction above the hardware abstraction.
Containers can be restricted in terms of usage of resources compared to VMs and services can be isolated.
They are self managed.
high portability across various platforms.
A docker image is like an OS with dependencies for supporting installed applications.

# Docker Architecture

- Docker Daemon: It creates and manages the images in containers, uploads and downloads registry.
- Docker Client: Can be configure to work with a local or remote docker engine.
